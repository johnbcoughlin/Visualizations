Michelle I love you
 The other night I think the entire country saw just how lucky I am
 Malia and Sasha you make me so proud but dont get any ideas youre still going to class tomorrow
  And Joe Biden thank you for being the best Vice President I could ever hope for
 

Madam Chairwoman delegates I accept your nomination for President of the United States


The first time I addressed this convention in 2004 I was a younger man a Senate candidate from Illinois who spoke about hope  not blind optimism or wishful thinking but hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward even when the odds are great even when the road is long
 

Eight years later that hope has been tested  by the cost of war by one of the worst economic crises in history and by political gridlock thats left us wondering whether its still possible to tackle the challenges of our time
   

I know that campaigns can seem small and even silly
  Trivial things become big distractions
  Serious issues become sound bites
  And the truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising
  If youre sick of hearing me approve this message believe me  so am I
 

But when all is said and done  when you pick up that ballot to vote  you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation
  Over the next few years big decisions will be made in Washington on jobs and the economy taxes and deficits energy and education war and peace  decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our childrens lives for decades to come
     

On every issue the choice you face wont be just between two candidates or two parties
 

It will be a choice between two different paths for America
 

A choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future


Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Pattons Army the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone
  

They knew they were part of something larger  a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression a nation where the most innovative businesses turned out the worlds best products and everyone shared in the pride and success  from the corner office to the factory floor
  My grandparents were given the chance to go to college buy their first home and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of Americas story  the promise that hard work will pay off that responsibility will be rewarded that everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules  from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington DC
 

I ran for President because I saw that basic bargain slipping away
  I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas
  And by 2008 we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that didnt racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition to put gas in the car or food on the table
  And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs their homes and their life savings  a tragedy from which we are still fighting to recover
   

Now our friends at the Republican convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America but they didnt have much to say about how theyd make it right
  They want your vote but they dont want you to know their plan
  And thats because all they have to offer is the same prescription theyve had for the last thirty years

Have a surplus Try a tax cut
 

Deficit too high Try another


Feel a cold coming on Take two tax cuts roll back some regulations and call us in the morning


Now Ive cut taxes for those who need it  middle-class families and small businesses
  But I dont believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores or pay down our deficit
  I dont believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China
  After all that weve been through I dont believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small businesswoman expand or the laid-off construction worker keep his home
  Weve been there weve tried that and were not going back
   Were moving forward
 

I wont pretend the path Im offering is quick or easy
  I never have
  You didnt elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear
  You elected me to tell you the truth
  And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades
  It will require common effort shared responsibility and the kind of bold persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one
  And by the way  those of us who carry on his partys legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington
 

But know this America  Our problems can be solved
  Our challenges can be met
  The path we offer may be harder but it leads to a better place
 And Im asking you to choose that future
  Im asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country  goals in manufacturing energy education national security and the deficit a real achievable plan that will lead to new jobs more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation
   Thats what we can do in the next four years and thats why Im running for a second term as President of the United States
 

We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs
  After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed were getting back to basics and doing what America has always done best

Were making things again
 

Ive met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared theyd never build another American car
  Today they cant build them fast enough because we reinvented a dying auto industry thats back on top of the world
   

Ive worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America  not because our workers make less pay but because we make better products
  Because we work harder and smarter than anyone else
   

Ive signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers  goods that are stamped with three proud words  Made in America
 

After a decade of decline this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years
  And now you have a choice  we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here in the United States of America
  We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports and if we choose this path we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years
  You can make that happen
  You can choose that future
 

You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy
  After thirty years of inaction we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas
   Weve doubled our use of renewable energy and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries
  In the last year alone we cut oil imports by one million barrels a day  more than any administration in recent history
  And today the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades


Now you have a choice  between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds on it
  Weve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years and well open more
  But unlike my opponent I will not let oil companies write this countrys energy plan or endanger our coastlines or collect another 4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers
  

Were offering a better path  a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy where we develop a hundred year supply of natural gas thats right beneath our feet
  If you choose this path we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600000 new jobs in natural gas alone
 

And yes my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet  because climate change is not a hoax
  More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke
  Theyre a threat to our childrens future
  And in this election you can do something about it
 

You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete no matter how old they are or how much money they have
  Education was the gateway to opportunity for me
  It was the gateway for Michelle
  And now more than ever it is the gateway to a middle-class life
 

For the first time in a generation nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning
  Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading
  Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders


And now you have a choice  we can gut education or we can decide that in the United States of America no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school
  No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they dont have the money
  No company should have to look for workers in China because they couldnt find any with the right skills here at home


Government has a role in this
  But teachers must inspire principals must lead parents must instill a thirst for learning and students youve got to do the work
  And together I promise you  we can out-educate and out-compete any country on Earth
  Help me recruit 100000 math and science teachers in the next ten years and improve early childhood education
  Help give two million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job
  Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next ten years
  We can meet that goal together
  You can choose that future for America
 

In a world of new threats and new challenges you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven
  Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq
  We did
  I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 911
  We have
  Weve blunted the Talibans momentum in Afghanistan and in 2014 our longest war will be over
  A new tower rises above the New York skyline al Qaeda is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead


Tonight we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harms way
  We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected
  We will never forget you
  And so long as Im Commander-in-Chief we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known
  When you take off the uniform we will serve you as well as youve served us  because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that they need when they come home
 

Around the world weve strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons
  Weve reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers
  From Burma to Libya to South Sudan we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings  men and women Christians and Muslims and Jews
      

But for all the progress weve made challenges remain
  Terrorist plots must be disrupted
  Europes crisis must be contained
  Our commitment to Israels security must not waver and neither must our pursuit of peace
  The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions
  The historic change sweeping across the Arab World must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate today
 

So now we face a choice
  My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy but from all that weve seen and heard they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly


After all you dont call Russia our number one enemy  and not al Qaeda  unless youre still stuck in a Cold War time warp
  You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you cant visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally
  My opponent said it was tragic to end the war in Iraq and he wont tell us how hell end the war in Afghanistan
  I have and I will
  And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs dont even want Ill use the money were no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work  rebuilding roads and bridges schools and runways
  After two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars its time to do some nation-building right here at home


You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without wrecking our middle class
  Independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficits by 4 trillion
  Last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut 1 trillion in spending  because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that its leaner more efficient and more responsive to the American people
 

I want to reform the tax code so that its simple fair and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over 250000  the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs the biggest surplus in history and a lot of millionaires to boot
 

Now Im still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission
  No party has a monopoly on wisdom
  No democracy works without compromise
  But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy  well you do the math
  I refuse to go along with that
  And as long as Im President I never will
 

I refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaires tax cut
  I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor elderly or disabled  all so those with the most can pay less
 

And I will never turn Medicare into a voucher
  No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies
  They should retire with the care and dignity they have earned
  Yes we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul but well do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more
  And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to Wall Street
  

This is the choice we now face
  This is what the election comes down to
  Over and over we have been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way that since government cant do everything it should do almost nothing
  If you cant afford health insurance hope that you dont get sick
  If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe well thats just the price of progress
  If you cant afford to start a business or go to college take my opponents advice and borrow money from your parents
 

You know what  Thats not who we are
  Thats not what this countrys about
  As Americans we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights  rights that no man or government can take away
  We insist on personal responsibility and we celebrate individual initiative
  Were not entitled to success
  We have to earn it
  We honor the strivers the dreamers the risk-takers who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known
 

But we also believe in something called citizenship  a word at the very heart of our founding at the very essence of our democracy the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations
 

We believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build the whole company does better
 

We believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they cant afford that family is protected but so is the value of other peoples homes and so is the entire economy
 

We believe that a little girl whos offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the founder of the next Google or the scientist who cures cancer or the President of the United States  and its in our power to give her that chance
 

We know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone
  We dont want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves and we dont want bailouts for banks that break the rules
  We dont think government can solve all our problems
  But we dont think that government is the source of all our problems  any more than are welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays or any other group were told to blame for our troubles
 

Because we understand that this democracy is ours
 

We the People recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks whats in it for me a freedom without a commitment to others a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense
 

As citizens we understand that America is not about what can be done for us
  Its about what can be done by us together through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government
 

So you see the election four years ago wasnt about me
  It was about you
  My fellow citizens  you were the change
 

Youre the reason theres a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix wholl get the surgery she needs because an insurance company cant limit her coverage
  You did that
 

Youre the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought hed be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance
  You made that possible
 

Youre the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country shes ever called home why selfless soldiers wont be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely Welcome home
 

If you turn away now  if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isnt possible well change will not happen
  If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference then other voices will fill the void lobbyists and special interests the people with the 10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are making it harder for you to vote Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry or control health care choices that women should make for themselves
 

Only you can make sure that doesnt happen
  Only you have the power to move us forward
 

I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention
  The times have changed  and so have I


Im no longer just a candidate
  Im the President
  I know what it means to send young Americans into battle for I have held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didnt return
  Ive shared the pain of families whove lost their homes and the frustration of workers whove lost their jobs
  If the critics are right that Ive made all my decisions based on polls then I must not be very good at reading them
  And while Im proud of what weve achieved together Im far more mindful of my own failings knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go
  

But as I stand here tonight I have never been more hopeful about America
  Not because I think I have all the answers
  Not because Im nave about the magnitude of our challenges
 

Im hopeful because of you
 

The young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter  she gives me hope
 

The auto worker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed but kept coming to work every day and bought flags for his whole town and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife  he gives me hope
 

The family business in Warroad Minnesota that didnt lay off a single one of their four thousand employees during this recession even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants even when it meant the owners gave up some perks and pay  because they understood their biggest asset was the community and the workers who helped build that business  they give me hope
 

And I think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed hospital still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee
  Six months ago I would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iraq tall and twenty pounds heavier dashing in his uniform with a big grin on his face sturdy on his new leg
  And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled
 

He gives me hope
 

I dont know what party these men and women belong to
  I dont know if theyll vote for me
  But I know that their spirit defines us
  They remind me in the words of Scripture that ours is a future filled with hope
 

And if you share that faith with me  if you share that hope with me  I ask you tonight for your vote
 

If you reject the notion that this nations promise is reserved for the few your voice must be heard in this election
 

If you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder you need to stand up in this election
 

If you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape that new energy can power our future that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules then I need you to vote this November
 

America I never said this journey would be easy and I wont promise that now
  Yes our path is harder  but it leads to a better place
  Yes our road is longer  but we travel it together
  We dont turn back
  We leave no one behind
  We pull each other up
  We draw strength from our victories and we learn from our mistakes but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon knowing that Providence is with us and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth
 

Thank you God bless you and may God bless these United States


PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON Thank you very much
 Thank you
 Thank you
 Sustained  
 Thank you
 Thank you
 Thank you
 Thank you


Now Mr
 Mayor fellow Democrats we are here to nominate a president
  
 And I've got one in mind
  


I want to nominate a man whose own life has known its fair share of adversity and uncertainty
 I want to nominate a man who ran for president to change the course of an already weak economy and then just six weeks before his election saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the Great Depression a man who stopped the slide into depression and put us on the long road to recovery knowing all the while that no matter how many jobs that he saved or created there'd still be millions more waiting worried about feeding their own kids trying to keep their hopes alive


I want to nominate a man who's cool on the outside     but who burns for America on the inside
  


I want  I want a man who believes with no doubt that we can build a new American Dream economy driven by innovation and creativity but education and  yes  by cooperation
 


And by the way after last night I want a man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama
  


You know   
 I   


I want  I want Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States
  
 And I proudly nominate him to be the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party


Now folks in Tampa a few days ago we heard a lot of talk  laughter  all about how the president and the Democrats don't really believe in free enterprise and individual initiative how we want everybody to be dependent on the government how bad we are for the economy


This Republican narrative  this alternative universe  laughter   says that every one of us in this room who amounts to anything we're all completely self-made
 One of the greatest chairmen the Democratic Party ever had Bob Strauss     used to say that ever politician wants every voter to believe he was born in a log cabin he built himself
 Laughter 
 But as Strauss then admitted it ain't so
 Laughter


We Democrats  we think the country works better with a strong middle class with real opportunities for poor folks to work their way into it     with a relentless focus on the future with business and government actually working together to promote growth and broadly share prosperity
 You see we believe that we're all in this together is a far better philosophy than you're on your own
  
 It is


So who's right 
 Well since 1961 for 52 years now the Republicans have held the White House 28 years the Democrats 24
 In those 52 years our private economy has produced 66 million private sector jobs


So what's the job score Republicans 24 million Democrats 42 million
  


Now there's     there's a reason for this
 It turns out that advancing equal opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and good economics
  
 Why Because poverty discrimination and ignorance restrict growth
  
 When you stifle human potential when you don't invest in new ideas it doesn't just cut off the people who are affected it hurts us all
  
 We know that investments in education and infrastructure and scientific and technological research increase growth
 They increase good jobs and they create new wealth for all the rest of us
  


Now there's something I've noticed lately
 You probably have too
 And it's this
 Maybe just because I grew up in a different time but though I often disagree with Republicans I actually never learned to hate them the way the far right that now controls their party seems to hate our president and a lot of other Democrats
 I     that would be impossible for me because President Eisenhower sent federal troops to my home state to integrate Little Rock Central High School
  
 President Eisenhower built the interstate highway system


When I was a governor I worked with President Reagan and his White House on the first round of welfare reform and with President George H
W
 Bush on national education goals


 
 I'm actually very grateful to  if you saw from the film what I do today I have to be grateful and you should be too  that President George W
 Bush supported PEPFAR
 It saved the lives of millions of people in poor countries
  


And I have been honored to work with both Presidents Bush on natural disasters in the aftermath of the South Asian tsunami Hurricane Katrina the horrible earthquake in Haiti
 Through my foundation both in America and around the world I'm working all the time with Democrats Republicans and independents
 Sometimes I couldn't tell you for the life who I'm working with because we focus on solving problems and seizing opportunities and not fighting all the time
  


And so here's what I want to say to you and here's what I want the people at home to think about
 When times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain the politics of constant conflict may be good
 But what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world
 What works in the real world is cooperation
  
 What works in the real world is cooperation business and government foundations and universities


Ask the mayors who are here
  
 Los Angeles is getting green and Chicago is getting an infrastructure bank because Republicans and Democrats are working together to get it
  
 They didn't check their brains at the door
 They didn't stop disagreeing but their purpose was to get something done


Now why is this true Why does cooperation work better than constant conflict

Because nobody's right all the time and a broken clock is right twice a day
  


And every one of us  every one of us and every one of them we're compelled to spend our fleeting lives between those two extremes knowing we're never going to be right all the time and hoping we're right more than twice a day
 Laughter


Unfortunately the faction that now dominates the Republican Party doesn't see it that way
 They think government is always the enemy they're always right and compromise is weakness
 Boos
 Just in the last couple of elections they defeated two distinguished Republican senators because they dared to cooperate with Democrats on issues important to the future of the country even national security
 


They beat a Republican congressman with almost a hundred percent voting record on every conservative score because he said he realized he did not have to hate the president to disagree with him
 Boy that was a nonstarter and they threw him out
 Laughter 


One of the main reasons we ought to re-elect President Obama is that he is still committed to constructive cooperation
  
 Look at his record
 Look at his record
  
 Look at his record
 He appointed Republican secretaries of defense the Army and transportation
 He appointed a vice president who ran against him in 2008
 Laughter 
 And he trusted that vice president to oversee the successful end of the war in Iraq and the implementation of the recovery act
  


And Joe Biden  Joe Biden did a great job with both
 Sustained  


He  sustained    President Obama  President Obama appointed several members of his Cabinet even though they supported Hillary in the primary
 
 Heck he even appointed Hillary
  


Wait a minute
 I am  sustained    I am very proud of her
 I am proud of the job she and the national security team have done for America
  
 I am grateful that they have worked together to make us safer and stronger to build a world with more partners and fewer enemies
 I'm grateful for the relationship of respect and partnership she and the president have enjoyed and the signal that sends to the rest of the world that democracy does not have a blood  have to be a blood sport it can be an honorable enterprise that advances the public interest
  


Now  sustained    besides the national security team I am very grateful to the men and women who've served our country in uniform through these perilous times
  
 And I am especially grateful to Michelle Obama and to Joe Biden for supporting those military families while their loved ones were overseas     and for supporting our veterans when they came home when they came home bearing the wounds of war or needing help to find education or jobs or housing


President Obama's whole record on national security is a tribute to his strength to his judgment and to his preference for inclusion and partnership over partisanship
 We need more if it in Washington D
C
  


Now we all know that he also tried to work with congressional Republicans on health care debt reduction and new jobs
 And that didn't work out so well
 Laughter
 But it could have been because as the Senate Republican leader said in a remarkable moment of candor two full years before the election their number one priority was not to put America back to work it was to put the president out of work
 Mixed  and boos 
 Chuckles
 Well wait a minute
 Senator I hate to break it to you but we're going to keep President Obama on the job
  


Now are you ready for that  
 Are you willing to work for it
 Oh wait a minute


 
 Four more years
 Four more years
 Four more years
 Four more years


 In Tampa 

 
 Four more years
 Four more years


 In Tampa  in Tampa  did y'all watch their convention

I did
 Laughter
 In Tampa the Republican argument against the president's re-election was actually pretty simple  pretty snappy
 It went something like this We left him a total mess
 He hasn't cleaned it up fast enough
 So fire him and put us back in
 Laughter 


Now     but they did it well
 They looked good the sounded good
 They convinced me that  laughter  they all love their families and their children and were grateful they'd been born in America and all that  laughter   really I'm not being  they did
 Laughter 


And this is important they convinced me they were honorable people who believed what they said and they're going to keep every commitment they've made
 We just got to make sure the American people know what those commitments are     because in order to look like an acceptable reasonable moderate alternative to President Obama they just didn't say very much about the ideas they've offered over the last two years


They couldn't because they want to the same old policies that got us in trouble in the first place
 They want to cut taxes for high- income Americans even more than President Bush did
 They want to get rid of those pesky financial regulations designed to prevent another crash and prohibit future bailouts
 They want to actually increase defense spending over a decade 2 trillion more than the Pentagon has requested without saying what they'll spend it on
 And they want to make enormous cuts in the rest of the budget especially programs that help the middle class and poor children


As another president once said there they go again


Laughter  


Now I like  I like  I like the argument for President Obama's re-election a lot better
 Here it is
 He inherited a deeply damaged economy
 He put a floor under the crash
 He began the long hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern more well- balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs vibrant new businesses and lots of new wealth for innovators
  


Now are we where we want to be today No


 No


 Is the president satisfied Of course not


 No


 But are we better off than we were when he took office  


And listen to this
 Listen to this
 Everybody  inaudible  when President Barack Obama took office the economy was in free fall
 It had just shrunk 9 full percent of GDP
 We were losing 750000 jobs a month


Are we doing better than that today

 Yes
 


 The answer is yes


Now look
 Here's the challenge he faces and the challenge all of you who support him face
 I get it
 I know it
 I've been there
 A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated about this economy
 If you look at the numbers you know employment is growing banks are beginning to lend again
 And in a lot of places housing prices are even beginning to pick up


But too many people do not feel it yet


I had the same thing happen in 1994 and early '95
 We could see that the policies were working that the economy was growing
 But most people didn't feel it yet
 Thankfully by 1996 the economy was roaring everybody felt it and we were halfway through the longest peacetime expansion in the history of the United States
 But     wait wait
 The difference this time is purely in the circumstances
 President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did
 Listen to me now
 No president  no president not me not any of my predecessors no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years
  


Now  but     he has  he has laid the foundation for a new modern successful economy of shared prosperity
 And if you will renew the president's contract you will feel it
 You will feel it
  


Folks whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election
 I just want you to know that I believe it
 With all my heart I believe it
  


Now why do I believe it

I'm fixing to tell you why
 I believe it because President Obama's approach embodies the values the ideas and the direction America has to take to build the 21st-century version of the American Dream a nation of shared opportunities shared responsibilities shared prosperity a shared sense of community


So let's get back to the story
 In 2010 as the president's recovery program kicked in the job losses stopped and things began to turn around
 The recovery act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes  let me say this again  cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people
  
 And in the last 29 months our economy has produced about 4 12 million private sector jobs
  


We could have done better but last year the Republicans blocked the president's job plan costing the economy more than a million new jobs


So here's another job score
 President Obama plus 4 12 million
 Congressional Republicans zero
  


During this period     during this period more than 500000 manufacturing jobs have been created under President Obama
 That's the first time manufacturing jobs have increased since the 1990s
  
 And I'll tell you something else
 The auto industry restructuring worked
  
 It saved  it saved more than a million jobs and not just at GM Chrysler and their dealerships but in auto parts manufacturing all over the country


That's why even the automakers who weren't part of the deal supported it
 They needed to save those parts suppliers too
 Like I said we're all in this together
 


So what's happened There are now 250000 more people working in the auto industry than on the day the companies were restructured
  


So  now we all know that Governor Romney opposed the plan to save GM and Chrysler
 Boos
 So here's another job score
 Laughter
 Are you listening in Michigan and Ohio and across the country 
 Here     here's another job score Obama 250000 Romney zero


 With speaker
 Zero
  


 Now the agreement the administration made with the management labor and environmental groups to double car mileage that was a good deal too
 It will cut your gas prices in half your gas bill
 No matter what the price is if you double the mileage of your car your bill will be half what it would have been
 It will make us more energy independent
 It will cut greenhouse gas emissions
 And according to several analyses over the next 20 years it'll bring us another half a million good new jobs into the American economy
  


The president's energy strategy which he calls all of the above is helping too
 The boom in oil and gas production combined with greater energy efficiency has driven oil imports to a near-20- year low and natural gas production to an all-time high
 And renewable energy production has doubled


 


Of course we need a lot more new jobs
 But there are already more than 3 million jobs open and unfilled in America mostly because the people who apply for them don't yet have the required skills to do them
 So even as we get Americans more jobs we have to prepare more Americans for the new jobs that are actually going to be created
 The old economy is not coming back
 We've got to build a new one and educate people to do those jobs
  


The president  the president and his education secretary have supported community colleges and employers in working together to train people for jobs that are actually open in their communities  and even more important after a decade in which exploding college costs have increased the dropout rate so much that the percentage of our young people with four-year college degrees has gone down so much that we have dropped to 16th in the world in the percentage of young people with college degrees


So the president's student loan is more important than ever
 Here's what it does     here's what it does
 You need to tell every voter where you live about this
 It lowers the cost of federal student loans
 And even more important it give students the right to repay those loans as a clear fixed low percentage of their income for up to 20 years
  


Now what does this mean What does this mean Think of it
 It means no one will ever have to drop out of college again for fear they can't repay their debt


And it means     it means that if someone wants to take a job with a modest income a teacher a police officer if they want to be a small-town doctor in a little rural area they won't have to turn those jobs down because they don't pay enough to repay they debt
 Their debt obligation will be determined by their salary
 This will change the future for young America
  


I don't know about you     but on all these issues I know we're better off because President Obama made the decisions he did


Now that brings me to health care
  
 And the Republicans call it derisively Obamacare
 They say it's a government takeover a disaster and that if we'll just elect them they'll repeal it
 Well are they right

 No


 Let's take a look at what's actually happened so far


First individuals and businesses have already gotten more than a billion dollars in refunds from insurance companies because the new law requires 80 percent to 85 percent of your premium to go to your health care not profits or promotion
  
 And the gains are even greater than that because a bunch of insurance companies have applied to lower their rates to comply with the requirement


Second more than 3 million young people between 19 and 25 are insured for the first time because their parents' policies can cover them


 


Millions of seniors are receiving preventive care all the way from breast cancer screenings to tests for heart problems and scores of other things
 And younger people are getting them too


Fourth soon the insurance companies  not the government the insurance companies  will have millions of new customers many of them middle-class people with pre-existing conditions who never could get insurance before
  


Now finally listen to this
 For the last two years  after going up at three times the rate of inflation for a decade for the last two years health care costs have been under 4 percent in both years for the first time in 50 years
  


So let me ask you something
 Are we better off because President Obama fought for health care reform  
 You bet we are


Now there were two other attacks on the president in Tampa I think deserve an answer
 First both Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan attacked the president for allegedly robbing Medicare of 716 billion
 That's the same attack they leveled against the Congress in 2010 and they got a lot of votes on it
 But it's not true
 


Look here's what really happened
 You be the judge
 Here's what really happened
 There were no cuts to benefits at all
 None
 What the president did was to save money by taking the recommendations of a commission of professionals to cut unwarranted subsidies to providers and insurance companies that were not making people healthier and were not necessary to get the providers to provide the service


And instead of raiding Medicare he used the savings to close the doughnut hole in the Medicare drug program     and  you all got to listen carefully to this this is really important  and to add eight years to the life of the Medicare trust fund so it is solvent till 2024
  


So  chuckles  so President Obama and the Democrats didn't weaken Medicare they strengthened Medicare
 Now when Congressman Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama's Medicare savings as quote the biggest coldest power play I didn't know whether to laugh or cry  laughter  because that 716 billion is exactly to the dollar the same amount of Medicare savings that he has in his own budget
  
 You got to get one thing  it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did
 Laughter  


So  inaudible  sustained    now you're having a good time but this is getting serious and I want you to listen


Laughter
 It's important because a lot of people believe this stuff


Now at least on this issue on this one issue Governor Romney has been consistent
 Laughter
 He attacked President Obama too but he actually wants to repeal those savings and give the money back to the insurance company
 Laughter boos


He wants to go back to the old system which means we'll reopen the doughnut hole and force seniors to pay more for drugs and we'll reduce the life of the Medicare trust fund by eight full years
 Boos


So if he's elected and if he does what he promised to do Medicare will now grow sicgo broke in 2016
 Boos
 Think about that
 That means after all we won't have to wait until their voucher program kicks in 2023  laughter  to see the end of Medicare as we know it
 
 They're going to do it to us sooner than we thought
 


Now folks this is serious because it gets worse
 Laughter
 And you won't be laughing when I finish telling you this
 They also want to block-grant Medicaid and cut it by a third over the coming 10 years


AUDIENCE MEMBER No


 Of course that's going to really hurt a lot of poor kids
 But that's not all
 Lot of folks don't know it but nearly two-thirds of Medicaid is spent on nursing home care for Medicare seniors    who are eligible for Medicaid


 
 It's going to end Medicare as we know it
 And a lot of that money is also spent to help people with disabilities including     a lot of middle-class families whose kids have Down's syndrome or autism or other severe conditions
 
 And honestly let's think about it if that happens I don't know what those families are going to do


So I know what I'm going to do
 I'm going to do everything I can to see that it doesn't happen
 We can't let it happen
  
 We can't
  
 Now  wait a minute
  
 Let's look 

 Four more years
 Four more years
 Four more years


 Let's look at the other big charge the Republicans made
 It's a real doozy
 Laughter
 They actually have charged and run ads saying that President Obama wants to weaken the work requirements in the welfare reform bill I signed that moved millions of people from welfare to work
 
 Wait you need to know here's what happened
 Laughter
 Nobody ever tells you what really happened  here's what happened


When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work the Obama administration listened because we all know it's hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today
 So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge


And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment
 Now did I make myself clear The requirement was for more work not less
  


So this is personal to me
 We moved millions of people off welfare
 It was one of the reasons that in the eight years I was president we had a hundred times as many people move out of poverty into the middle class than happened under the previous 12 years a hundred times as many
  
 It's a big deal
 But I am telling you the claim that President Obama weakened welfare reform's work requirement is just not true
 


But they keep on running the ads claiming it
 You want to know why Their campaign pollster said we are not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers
  
 Now finally I can say that is true
 Laughter  
 I  chuckles  I couldn't have said it better myself
 Laughter


And I hope you and every American within the sound of my voice remembers it every time they see one of those ads and it turns into an ad to re-elect Barack Obama and keep the fundamental principles of personal empowerment and moving everybody who can get a job into work as soon as we can
  


Now let's talk about the debt
 Today interest rates are low lower than the rate of inflation
 People are practically paying us to borrow money to hold their money for them


But it will become a big problem when the economy grows and interest rates start to rise
 We've got to deal with this big long- term debt problem or it will deal with us
 It will gobble up a bigger and bigger percentage of the federal budget we'd rather spend on education and health care and science and technology
 It  we've got to deal with it


Now what has the president done He has offered a reasonable plan of 4 trillion in debt reduction over a decade with 2 12 trillion dollars coming from  for every 2 12 trillion in spending cuts he raises a dollar in new revenues  2 12-to-1
 And he has tight controls on future spending
 That's the kind of balanced approach proposed by the Simpson-Bowles Commission a bipartisan commission


Now I think this plan is way better than Governor Romney's plan
 First the Romney plan failed the first test of fiscal responsibility
 The numbers just don't add up
 Laughter 


I mean consider this
 What would you do if you had this problem Somebody says oh we've got a big debt problem
 We've got to reduce the debt
 So what's the first thing you say we're going to do Well to reduce the debt we're going to have another 5 trillion in tax cuts heavily weighted to upper-income people
 So we'll make the debt hole bigger before we start to get out of it


Now when you say what are you going to do about this 5 trillion you just added on They say oh we'll make it up by eliminating loopholes in the tax code


So then you ask well which loopholes and how much

You know what they say See me about that after the election
 Laughter


I'm not making it up
 That's their position
 See me about that after the election


Now people ask me all the time how we got four surplus budgets in a row
 What new ideas did we bring to Washington I always give a one-word answer Arithmetic
 Sustained  


If  arithmetic
 If    if they stay with their 5 trillion tax cut plan  in a debt reduction plan  the arithmetic tells us no matter what they say one of three things is about to happen
 One assuming they try to do what they say they'll do get rid of  pay  cover it by deductions cutting those deductions one they'll have to eliminate so many deductions like the ones for home mortgages and charitable giving that middle-class families will see their tax bills go up an average of 2000 while anybody who makes 3 million or more will see their tax bill go down 250000
 Boos


Or two they'll have to cut so much spending that they'll obliterate the budget for the national parks for ensuring clean air clean water safe food safe air travel
 They'll cut way back on Pell Grants college loans early childhood education child nutrition programs all the programs that help to empower middle-class families and help poor kids
 Oh they'll cut back on investments in roads and bridges and science and technology and biomedical research


That's what they'll do
 They'll hurt the middle class and the poor and put the future on hold to give tax cuts to upper-income people who've been getting it all along


Or three in spite of all the rhetoric they'll just do what they've been doing for more than 30 years
 They'll go in and cut the taxes way more than they cut spending especially with that big defense increase and they'll just explode the debt and weaken the economy
 And they'll destroy the federal government's ability to help you by letting interest gobble up all your tax payments


Don't you ever forget when you hear them talking about this that Republican economic policies quadrupled the national debt before I took office in the 12 years before I took office    and doubled the debt in the eight years after I left because it defied arithmetic
 Laughter 
 It was a highly inconvenient thing for them in our debates that I was just a country boy from Arkansas and I came from a place where people still thought two and two was four
 Laughter 
 It's arithmetic


We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickle down
  
 Really
 Think about this President Obama  President Obama's plan cuts the debt honors our values brightens the future of our children our families and our nation
 It's a heck of a lot better


It passes the arithmetic test and far more important it passes the values test
  


My fellow Americans all of us in this grand hall and everybody watching at home when we vote in this election we'll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in
 If you want a winner-take- all you're-on-your-own society you should support the Republican ticket
 But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility a we're-all-in-this-together society you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden
  
 If you  if you want 

 
 Four more years
 Four more years


 If you want America  if you want every American to vote and you think it is wrong to change voting procedures    just to reduce the turnout of younger poorer minority and disabled voters    you should support Barack Obama
  


And if you think  if you think the president was right to open the doors of American opportunity to all those young immigrants brought here when they were young so they can serve in the military or go to college you must vote for Barack Obama
  
 If you want a future of shared prosperity where the middle class is growing and poverty is declining where the American dream is really alive and well again and where the United States maintains its leadership as a force for peace and justice and prosperity in this highly competitive world you have to vote for Barack Obama


 


Look I love our country so much
 And I know we're coming back
 For more than 200 years through every crisis we've always come back
 
 People have predicted our demise ever since George Washington was criticized for being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of wooden false teeth
 Laughter
 And so far every single person that's bet against America has lost money because we always come back
  
 We come through ever fire a little stronger and a little better


And we do it because in the end we decide to champion the cause for which our founders pledged their lives their fortunes their sacred honor  the cause of forming a more perfect union
  
 My fellow Americans if that is what you want if that is what you believe you must vote and you must re-elect President Barack Obama
  
 God bless you and God bless America
 Thank you so much Elaine we are so grateful for your family's service and sacrifice and we will always have your back


Over the past few years as First Lady I have had the extraordinary privilege of traveling all across this country


And everywhere I've gone in the people I've met and the stories I've heard I have seen the very best of the American spirit


I have seen it in the incredible kindness and warmth that people have shown me and my family especially our girls


I've seen it in teachers in a near-bankrupt school district who vowed to keep teaching without pay


I've seen it in people who become heroes at a moment's notice diving into harm's way to save others flying across the country to put out a fire driving for hours to bail out a flooded town
 

And I've seen it in our men and women in uniform and our proud military families in wounded warriors who tell me they're not just going to walk again they're going to run and they're going to run marathons in the young man blinded by a bomb in Afghanistan who said simply  I'd give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what I have done and what I can still do


Every day the people I meet inspire me every day they make me proud every day they remind me how blessed we are to live in the greatest nation on earth


Serving as your First Lady is an honor and a privilege but back when we first came together four years ago I still had some concerns about this journey we'd begun


While I believed deeply in my husband's vision for this country and I was certain he would make an extraordinary President like any mother I was worried about what it would mean for our girls if he got that chance


How would we keep them grounded under the glare of the national spotlight

How would they feel being uprooted from their school their friends and the only home they'd ever known

Our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys Saturdays at soccer games Sundays at grandma's house and a date night for Barack and me was either dinner or a movie because as an exhausted mom I couldn't stay awake for both


And the truth is I loved the life we had built for our girls I deeply loved the man I had built that life with and I didn't want that to change if he became President


I loved Barack just the way he was


You see even though back then Barack was a Senator and a presidential candidate to me he was still the guy who'd picked me up for our dates in a car that was so rusted out I could actually see the pavement going by through a hole in the passenger side door he was the guy whose proudest possession was a coffee table he'd found in a dumpster and whose only pair of decent shoes was half a size too small


But when Barack started telling me about his family  that's when I knew I had found a kindred spirit someone whose values and upbringing were so much like mine


You see Barack and I were both raised by families who didn't have much in the way of money or material possessions but who had given us something far more valuable  their unconditional love their unflinching sacrifice and the chance to go places they had never imagined for themselves


My father was a pump operator at the city water plant and he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis when my brother and I were young


And even as a kid I knew there were plenty of days when he was in pain I knew there were plenty of mornings when it was a struggle for him to simply get out of bed


But every morning I watched my father wake up with a smile grab his walker prop himself up against the bathroom sink and slowly shave and button his uniform


And when he returned home after a long day's work my brother and I would stand at the top of the stairs to our little apartment patiently waiting to greet him watching as he reached down to lift one leg and then the other to slowly climb his way into our arms


But despite these challenges my dad hardly ever missed a day of work he and my mom were determined to give me and my brother the kind of education they could only dream of


And when my brother and I finally made it to college nearly all of our tuition came from student loans and grants


But my dad still had to pay a tiny portion of that tuition himself


And every semester he was determined to pay that bill right on time even taking out loans when he fell short


He was so proud to be sending his kids to college and he made sure we never missed a registration deadline because his check was late


You see for my dad that's what it meant to be a man


Like so many of us that was the measure of his success in life  being able to earn a decent living that allowed him to support his family


And as I got to know Barack I realized that even though he'd grown up all the way across the country he'd been brought up just like me


Barack was raised by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills and by grandparents who stepped in when she needed help


Barack's grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank and she moved quickly up the ranks but like so many women she hit a glass ceiling


And for years men no more qualified than she was  men she had actually trained  were promoted up the ladder ahead of her earning more and more money while Barack's family continued to scrape by


But day after day she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus arriving at work before anyone else giving her best without complaint or regret


And she would often tell Barack So long as you kids do well Bar that's all that really matters


Like so many American families our families weren't asking for much


They didn't begrudge anyone else's success or care that others had much more than they did


in fact they admired it


They simply believed in that fundamental American promise that even if you don't start out with much if you work hard and do what you're supposed to do then you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids


That's how they raised us that's what we learned from their example


We learned about dignity and decency  that how hard you work matters more than how much you make that helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself


We learned about honesty and integrity  that the truth matters that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square


We learned about gratitude and humility  that so many people had a hand in our success from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect


Those are the values Barack and I  and so many of you  are trying to pass on to our own children


That's who we are


And standing before you four years ago I knew that I didn't want any of that to change if Barack became President


Well today after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways I never could have imagined I have seen firsthand that being president doesn't change who you are  it reveals who you are


You see I've gotten to see up close and personal what being president really looks like


And I've seen how the issues that come across a President's desk are always the hard ones  the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer the judgment calls where the stakes are so high and there is no margin for error


And as President you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people


But at the end of the day when it comes time to make that decision as President all you have to guide you are your values and your vision and the life experiences that make you who you are


So when it comes to rebuilding our economy Barack is thinking about folks like my dad and like his grandmother


He's thinking about the pride that comes from a hard day's work


That's why he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help women get equal pay for equal work


That's why he cut taxes for working families and small businesses and fought to get the auto industry back on its feet


That's how he brought our economy from the brink of collapse to creating jobs again  jobs you can raise a family on good jobs right here in the United States of America


When it comes to the health of our families Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day another president


He didn't care whether it was the easy thing to do politically  that's not how he was raised  he cared that it was the right thing to do


He did it because he believes that here in America our grandparents should be able to afford their medicine our kids should be able to see a doctor when they're sick and no one in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or illness


And he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care that's what my husband stands for


When it comes to giving our kids the education they deserve Barack knows that like me and like so many of you he never could've attended college without financial aid


And believe it or not when we were first married our combined monthly student loan bills were actually higher than our mortgage


We were so young so in love and so in debt


That's why Barack has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down because he wants every young person to fulfill their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt


So in the end for Barack these issues aren't political  they're personal


Because Barack knows what it means when a family struggles


He knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids


Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity no matter who we are or where we're from or what we look like or who we love


And he believes that when you've worked hard and done well and walked through that doorway of opportunity you do not slam it shut behind you you reach back and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed


So when people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband I can honestly say that when it comes to his character and his convictions and his heart Barack Obama is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago


He's the same man who started his career by turning down high paying jobs and instead working in struggling neighborhoods where a steel plant had shut down fighting to rebuild those communities and get folks back to work because for Barack success isn't about how much money you make it's about the difference you make in people's lives


He's the same man who when our girls were first born would anxiously check their cribs every few minutes to ensure they were still breathing proudly showing them off to everyone we knew


That's the man who sits down with me and our girls for dinner nearly every night patiently answering their questions about issues in the news and strategizing about middle school friendships


That's the man I see in those quiet moments late at night hunched over his desk poring over the letters people have sent him


The letter from the father struggling to pay his bills from the woman dying of cancer whose insurance company won't cover her care from the young person with so much promise but so few opportunities


I see the concern in his eyes


and I hear the determination in his voice as he tells me You won't believe what these folks are going through Michelle it's not right
  We've got to keep working to fix this
  We've got so much more to do


I see how those stories  our collection of struggles and hopes and dreams  I see how that's what drives Barack Obama every single day


And I didn't think it was possible but today I love my husband even more than I did four years ago even more than I did 23 years ago when we first met


I love that he's never forgotten how he started


I love that we can trust Barack to do what he says he's going to do even when it's hard  especially when it's hard


I love that for Barack there is no such thing as us and them  he doesn't care whether you're a Democrat a Republican or none of the above he knows that we all love our country and he's always ready to listen to good ideas he's always looking for the very best in everyone he meets


And I love that even in the toughest moments when we're all sweating it  when we're worried that the bill won't pass and it seems like all is lost  Barack never lets himself get distracted by the chatter and the noise


Just like his grandmother he just keeps getting up and moving forward with patience and wisdom and courage and grace


And he reminds me that we are playing a long game here and that change is hard and change is slow and it never happens all at once


But eventually we get there we always do


We get there because of folks like my Dad folks like Barack's grandmother men and women who said to themselves I may not have a chance to fulfill my dreams but maybe my children will maybe my grandchildren will


So many of us stand here tonight because of their sacrifice and longing and steadfast love because time and again they swallowed their fears and doubts and did what was hard


So today when the challenges we face start to seem overwhelming  or even impossible  let us never forget that doing the impossible is the history of this nation it's who we are as Americans it's how this country was built


And if our parents and grandparents could toil and struggle for us if they could raise beams of steel to the sky send a man to the moon and connect the world with the touch of a button then surely we can keep on sacrificing and building for our own kids and grandkids


And if so many brave men and women could wear our country's uniform and sacrifice their lives for our most fundamental rights then surely we can do our part as citizens of this great democracy to exercise those rights surely we can get to the polls and make our voices heard on Election Day


If farmers and  could win independence from an empire if immigrants could leave behind everything they knew for a better life on our shores if women could be dragged to jail for seeking the vote if a generation could defeat a depression and define greatness for all time if a young preacher could lift us to the mountaintop with his righteous dream and if proud Americans can be who they are and boldly stand at the altar with who they love then surely surely we can give everyone in this country a fair chance at that great American Dream


Because in the end more than anything else that is the story of this country  the story of unwavering hope grounded in unyielding struggle


That is what has made my story and Barack's story and so many other American stories possible


And I say all of this tonight not just as First Lady and not just as a wife


You see at the end of the day my most important title is still mom-in-chief


My daughters are still the heart of my heart and the center of my world


But today I have none of those worries from four years ago about whether Barack and I were doing what's best for our girls


Because today I know from experience that if I truly want to leave a better world for my daughters and all our sons and daughters if we want to give all our children a foundation for their dreams and opportunities worthy of their promise if we want to give them that sense of limitless possibility  that belief that here in America there is always something better out there if you're willing to work for it then we must work like never before and we must once again come together and stand together for the man we can trust to keep moving this great country forward my husband our President President Barack Obama


Thank you God bless you and God bless America


Welcome to the 2012 Democratic National Convention
 Our city is a hub of energy and commerce a place where business and government work together and make things happen
 And in this election we are the city where Americans have come together to move our country forward and make great things possible
 We have always been that kind of city


Nearly half a century ago when cities throughout the South struggled to desegregate schools Charlotteans came together
 Around kitchen tables black and white families met and decided together to break down the barriers that had so long divided their children
 And because they did they gave a generation of kids a chance to go to school together to learn together and to recognize that no wall is too high or too strong to be broken down if we do it together


I was one of those children
 I learned what it truly meant to be judged by the content of one's character
 I was born to a single mom and raised by her and my grandparents
 They taught me to take pride in hard work to take responsibility for my actions and to understand that education could expand my mind and transform my life
 From West Charlotte High School to Davidson College where I was the first black student body president from NYU Law School to practicing law in the public and private sectors from the Charlotte City Council to becoming Charlotte's first Democratic mayor in 22 years to this stage tonight I live by the values my family and what this community taught me


And you know what I have seen President Obama at work and these are his values too
 This is a man who pulled our economy back from the brink
 This is a president who plans to give every child an opportunity to succeed
 This is a leader who believes all Americans should have a fair shot to go as far their talents can take them


So Charlotte North Carolina America when this convention ends on Thursday our work does not
 Over the next 62 daysfrom this night until election nightwe will come together as we have so many times before
 We will knock on doors and register voters
 We will stand up for a leader who will move this country forward


And together we will re-elect President Barack Obama


What a night
 What a crowd
 Thank you AngieI'm so proud of you and how far you've come
 I'm so proud to stand before you tonight not only as the wife of our vice president but as a full-time teacher and a military mom
 I'm here for our son Beau and for all of our troops veterans and military families


Four years ago Beau stood on this stage to introduce his father and soon afterward he deployed to Iraq for a year with the Delaware Army National Guard
 Tonight thanks to the leadership of President Obama and my husband Joe the war in Iraq is over


I'm also here tonight for my studentsstudents like Angiewho work so hard to create a better life for themselves and their families
 I've been a teacher for more than 30 years and to this day I continue to teach full time at a community college in northern Virginia


Not long after Joe was elected vice president people started questioning whether I could keep teaching
 Not Joe
 He was there standing by my side saying Of course you should
 It's who you are Jill
 For me being a teacher isn't just what I doit's who I am
 These issues are personal to me
 And for the more than 37 years I've known Joe I've seen firsthand just how personal they are to him too


Joe often tells people that I didn't agree to marry him until the fifth time he asked me
 The truth is that I loved him from the start
 I saw in him then the same character that I see in him today
 I've seen Joe's character in his optimism
 For families who have lost a loved one kids struggling to find their way workers out of a job Joe always works to give people a sense of hope


I've also seen Joe's character in his determination
 Two decades ago when Joe started working on the Violence Against Women Act domestic violence was often treated as a private family matter rather than the crime it is
 But Joe knew that he had to bring this issue out into the open
 And in the years since that bill passed I've had women tell me that their sisters or their friends wouldn't be alive todayif it weren't for Joe


Finally I've seen Joe's character in his heart
 When I first met him Joe had already seen just how fragile life could be
 When he was 29 years old Joe lost his first wife and baby daughter in a tragic car accident while they were out getting their Christmas tree and the boys were critically injured
 Joe's life was shattered
 But through his strong Catholic faith and his fierce love for our boys Joe found the strength to get back up


That's Joethat optimism that determination that big strong heart that drives him forward every day
 It's what he learned as a young boy growing up with two hard-working parents in Scranton Pennsylvania
 It's what makes him such a loving and supportive father of our three children Beau Hunter and Ashley
 And it's what drives him today as he and President Obama fight to strengthen the middle class they grew up in


For as long as I've known him Joe has never given up never failed to see the possibilities and never had any doubt about who he's fighting for
 And as long as he has the privilege of serving this nation I know from the bottom of my heart that he will continue to fight for you every day


Thank you
 God bless our troops and God bless our military families


It's an honor to be here tonight
 I speak to you not as a representative of young Hollywood but as a representative of the many millions of young Americans particularly young women who depend on public and nonprofit programs to help them survive


I grew up in New York City with four siblings
 My father barely made enough to get by
 We moved every year and we finally settled in a housing development for lower middle income families
 We went to public schools and depended on programs for school transport and lunches as did most of my friends
 My girlfriends from high school to this day still depend on Planned Parenthood and often Medicaid for important health care services


In 2008 less than half of all eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 voted
 Young America why are we only speaking with half our voice when so many issues at stake here directly affect us  You know who I'm voting for
 I'm not going to tell you who to vote for
 I'm here to ask you to commit to vote


It's never been easier than now
 Go to commit
BarackObama
com to register to find your polling location and any other information you need
  It's that easy


Earlier this week Chelsea Clinton reminded us that we are the generation whose voices haven't been heard
 Vote so that your voice is heard
  Over the last two days we've been reminded of something that perhaps we forgot what has been accomplished and what is at stake


Whether we can get health care afford college be guaranteed equal payall at risk
 And that's why I'm here todayto use whatever attention I'm fortunate enough to receive to shed the spotlight on what's at stake for all of us


When I was a little girl my mothera registered Democratwould take me into the polling booth and tell me which buttons to press and when to pull the lever
 Is that even legal I remember the excitement I felt in that secret box and feeling like my mom's vote wasn't just about the candidate it was about our familyand all the families just like ours


This last election I finally got to punch those buttons for me for real
 I wore my I voted pin the whole day
 It was my finest accessory
 And this year on November 6th I'm filled with that same enthusiasm that same pride to press the button to reelect President Barack Obama


So get out there and exercise your right to vote


My name is Tammy Duckworth
 I'm running to serve Illinois' 8th Congressional District
 My father served in the Army and the Marine Corps
 A Vietnam vet his family has worn our nation's uniform since the American Revolution
 My husband is an Army officer
 My brother saved lives in the Coast Guard
 My mom is Thai and Chinese
 She proudly became a citizen in her fifties


Dad's work took us all over the world until he lost his job
 It was a tough time
 We used up our savings moved into a studio apartment
 But our family did the responsible thing and rolled up our sleeves
 Mom took in sewing


My 55-year-old dad tried to find work
 But at 15 I was the only one with a jobafter school for minimum wage
 Thank God for the food stamps public education and Pell grants that helped me finish high school and college


In time we pulled through
 With this start I was able to earn my own commission as an Army officer
 I became an assault helicopter pilot working my way up to command a Blackhawk helicopter company
 In 2003 my National Guard unit was mobilized and I became one of the first Army women to fly combat missions in Iraq


Almost a year into my tour I was wounded and recovered at Walter Reed with other wounded warriors
 Some of us had obvious injuries
 Others had scars on the inside that were less visible but no less real
 At the hospital I realized my new responsibility to honor the buddies who saved me by serving our military men and women
 I became director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs
 We led the nation in screening for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress and we created a tax credit for Illinois businesses that hire veterans


Then President Obama asked me to help keep our sacred trust with veterans of all eras at the U
S
 Department of Veterans Affairs
 We worked to end the outrage of vets having to sleep on the same streets they once defended
 We improved services for female veterans
 I reached out to young vets by creating the Office for Online Communications


Barack Obama has also lived up to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief ending the war in Iraq refocusing on Afghanistan and eradicating terrorist leaders including bin Laden
 President Obama pushed for fairness in the military listening to commanders as we ended don't ask don't tell and on how to allow women to officially serve in more combat jobsbecause America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty as her sons


When it comes to our men and women in harm's way we have a clear choice on November 6th
 Last week Mitt Romney had a chance to show his support for the brave men and women he is seeking to command
 But he chose to criticize President Obama instead of even uttering the word Afghanistan


Barack Obama will never ignore our troops
 He will fight for them
 That's why he is my choice on November 6th
 My choice is to do what my family did when times were hard roll up our sleeves and get to work
 My choice is to do what my crew did for me in a dusty field in Iraq


On November 12th 2004 I was co-piloting my Blackhawk north of Baghdad when we started taking enemy fire
 A rocket-propelled grenade hit our helicopter exploding in my lap ripping off one leg crushing the other and tearing my right arm apart
 But I kept trying to fly until I passed out
 In that moment my survival and the survival of my entire crew depended on all of us pulling together
 And even though they were wounded themselves and insurgents were nearby they refused to leave a fallen comrade behind
 Their heroism is why I'm alive today


Ultimately that's what this election is about
 Yes it's about the issues that matter to us building an economy that will create jobs here at home and out-compete countries around the world
 But it's also about something else
 It's about whether we will do for our fellow Americans what my crew did for me whether we'll look out for the hardest hit and the disabled whether we'll pull together in a time of need whether we'll refuse to give up until the job is done


So let's finish what we started
 Let's keep moving forward with Barack Obama
 Let's do what this country has always done look adversity in the eye and work together to overcome it
 God bless our military and their families and God bless America


In this campaign we have a fundamental choice
 Will we protect our country and our allies advance our interests and ideals do battle where we must and make peace where we can Or will we entrust our place in the world to someone who just hasn't learned the lessons of the last decade

We've all learned Mitt Romney doesn't know much about foreign policy
  But he has all these neocon advisors who know all the wrong things about foreign policy
 He would rely on themafter all he's the great outsourcer


But I say to you This is not the time to outsource the job of commander in chief
 Our opponents like to talk about American exceptionalism but all they do is talk
 They forget that we are exceptional not because we say we are but because we do exceptional things
 We break out of the Great Depression win two world wars save lives fighting AIDS pull people out of poverty defend freedom go to the moonand produce exceptional people who even give their lives for civil rights and human rights


Despite what you heard in Tampa an exceptional country does care about the rise of the oceans and the future of the planet
 That is a responsibility from the Scripturesand that too is a responsibility of the leader of the free world
 The only thing exceptional about today's Republicans is thatalmost without exceptionthey oppose everything that has made America exceptional in the first place
 An exceptional nation demands the leadership of an exceptional president
 And my fellow Americans that president is Barack Obama


Just measure the disarray and disaster he inherited
 A war of choice in Iraq had become a war without end and a war of necessity in Afghanistan had become a war of neglect
 Our alliances were shredded
 Our moral authority was in tatters
 America was isolated in the world
 Our military was stretched to the breaking point
 Iran was marching unchecked towards a nuclear weapon
 And Osama bin Laden was still plotting


It took President Obama to make America lead like America again
 It took President Obama to restore our moral authorityand to ban torture
 This president understands that our values do not limit our powerthey magnify it
 He showed that global leadership is a strategic imperative for America not a favor we do for other countries


And President Obama kept his promises
 He promised to end the war in Iraqand he hasand our heroes have come home
 He promised to end the war in Afghanistan responsiblyand he isand our heroes there are coming home
 He promised to focus like a laser on al-Qaedaand he hasour forces have eliminated more of its leadership in the last three years than in all the eight years that came before
 And after more than ten years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 911 after Mitt Romney said it would be naive to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists it took President Obama against the advice of many to give that order to finally rid this earth of Osama bin Laden
 Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago


Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel to tighten sanctions on Iranand take nothing off the table


Again and again the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done
 But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straighthe said our two countries have exactly the same policyour security cooperation is unprecedented


 When it comes to Israel I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day


President Obama promised to work with Russia to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and signed an historic treaty that does just that
 He promised to lock down nuclear materials around the world and he has done just that
 He refused to accept the false choice between force without diplomacy or diplomacy without force
 When a brutal dictator promised to kill his own people like rats President Obama enlisted our allies built the coalition and shared the burden so that todaywithout a single American casualtyMoammar Gadhafi is gone and the people of Libya are free


So on one side of this campaign we have a president who has made America lead like America again
 What is there on the other side An extreme and expedient candidate who lacks the judgment and vision so vital in the Oval Office
 The most inexperienced foreign policy twosome to run for president and vice president in decades


It isn't fair to say Mitt Romney doesn't have a position on Afghanistan
 He has every position
 He was against setting a date for withdrawalthen he said it was rightand then he left the impression that maybe it was wrong to leave this soon
 He said it was tragic to leave Iraq and then he said it was fine
 He said we should've intervened in Libya sooner
 Then he ran down a hallway to duck reporters' questions
 Then he said the intervention was too aggressive
 Then he said the world was a better place because the intervention succeeded
 Talk about being for it before you were against it


Mr
 Romneyhere's a little advice Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy you better finish the debate with yourself


President Mitt Romneythree hypothetical words that mystified and alienated our allies this summer
 For Mitt Romney an overseas trip is what you call it when you trip all over yourself overseas
 It wasn't a goodwill missionit was a blooper reel


But a Romney-Ryan foreign policy would be anything but funny
 Every president of both parties for 60 years has worked for nuclear arms controlbut not Mitt Romney
 Republican secretaries of state from Kissinger to Baker Powell to Rice President Bush and 71 United States senators all supported President Obama's New Start treaty
 But not Mitt Romney
 He's even blurted out the preposterous notion that Russia is our number one geopolitical foe
 Folks Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from Alaska Mitt Romney talks like he's only seen Russia by watching Rocky IV


So here's the choice in 2012
 Mitt Romney out of touch at home out of his depth abroad and out of the mainstream
 Or Barack Obama a president who is giving new life and truth to America's indispensable role in the world a commander-in-chief who gives our troops the tools and training they need in war the honor and help they've earned when they come home a man who will never ask other men and women to fight a war without a plan to win the peace


And let me say something else
 No nominee for president should ever fail in the midst of a war to pay tribute to our troops overseas in his acceptance speech
 Mitt Romney was talking about America
 They are on the front lines every day defending America and they deserve our thanks


Some of us from a prior war remember coming home was not always easy
 President Obama has made it his mission that we welcome our troops home with care and concern and the respect they deserve
 That is how an exceptional nation says thank you to its most exceptional men and women
  Mitt Romney says he believes in America and he'll restore American exceptionalism
 I have news for him We already have an exceptional American as presidentand we believe in Barack Obama


Thank you
 What an incredible night
 Optimism is in the air
 And what an honor to be here with you to stand with our president Barack Obama
 Half a century ago Ronald Reagan the man whose relentless optimism inspired me to enter politics famously said that he didn't leave the Democratic Party the party left him
 I can certainly relate
 I didn't leave the Republican Party it left me
 Then again as my friend Jeb Bush recently noted Reagan himself would have been too moderate and too reasonable for today's GOP


We face serious challenges in this country
 We must create good middle-class jobs so we can have an economy built to last
 We must rebuild our roads and bridges and improve our public schools
 And particularly important to me and my state is the challenge of saving Medicare and Social Security so we can keep our promise to seniors
 But there are common sense solutions within our reach if we have leaders who are willing and enthusiastic to find common ground
 No political party has a monopoly on that kind of leadership
 But as a former lifelong Republican it pains me to tell you that today's Republicansand their standard-bearers Mitt Romney and Paul Ryanjust aren't up to the task
 They're beholden to my way or the highway bullies indebted to billionaires who bankroll ads and allergic to the very idea of compromise
 Ronald Reagan would not have stood for that
 Barack Obama does not stand for that
 You and I won't stand for that


I'll be honest with you I don't agree with President Obama about everything
 But I've gotten to know him I've worked with him and the choice is crystal clear
  When he took office the economic crisis had already put my state of Florida on the edge of disaster
 The foreclosure crisis was consuming homeowners the tourists we depend on couldn't afford to visit and our vital construction industry had come to a standstill
 President Obama saw what I saw a catastrophe in the making
 And he took action


One of his first trips in office brought him to Fort Myers where I was proud to embrace him and his plan to keep our teachers police and firefighters on the job
 Well that hug caused me more grief from my former party than you can ever imagine
 But even as the Republican Party fought tooth and nail to stop him this president showed his courage invested in Americaand saved Florida
 Two years later Florida and the Gulf Coast faced the worst environmental disaster in our nation's history this time when a ruptured well spilled nearly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico
 President Obama came to our rescue again leading a massive cleanup effort and demanding accountability from those responsible
 He didn't see a red state or a blue state
 He simply saw Americans who needed help
  And I once again saw the leader our country needs


You know I used to play quarterback just down the road from here at Wake Forest
 My dad always told me Charlie it takes a cool head to win a hot game
 Our country is in the middle of a hot game
 We face serious challenges both at home and abroad
 Meanwhile our politics are defined by discord and discontent
 Never has it been harder for a president to keep a cool head
 And never has it been more important
 I look around Florida and I see a state bursting with diversity and opportunity a state that looks like America's future
 When I look at the Republican ticket today I see two candidates who would break the fundamental promise of Medicare and Social Security and cut investments in our middle class which are so important to our economic recovery
 And when I look at President Obama I see a leader with a cool head a caring heart and an open mind a president who has demonstrated through his demeanor and through his deeds that he is uniquely qualified to heal our divisions rebuild our nation and lead us to a brighter future together


That's the leader Florida needs
 That's the leader America needs
 And that's the reason I'm here tonight not as a Republican not as a Democrat but as an optimistic American who understands that we must come together behind the one man who can lead the way forward in these challenging times my president our president Barack Obama
 And if you see the president before I do give him a hug for Charlie


I'm so grateful to be here with all of you tonight


I'm here not just as an actress but as a woman an African-American a granddaughter of Ellis Island immigrants a person who could not have afforded college without the help of student loans and as one of millions of volunteers working to re-elect President Obama


So many struggled so that all of us could have a voice in this great democracy and live up to the first three words of our constitution We the people
 I love that phrase so much
 Throughout our country's history we've expanded the meaning of that phrase to include more and more of us
 That's what it means to move forward
 And that's what this election is all about


Look I get it
 Whether it's school work family we've all got a lot on our minds
 People say to me I'm just too busy to think about politics
 But here's the thing You may not be thinking about politics but politics is thinking about you


Today there are people trying take away rights that our mothers grandmothers and great-grandmothers fought for our right to vote our right to choose affordable quality education equal pay access to health care
 We the people can't let that happen


Tonight even as this convention is coming to a close a movement is being built across our country
 The other side wants to take away our voice and render us invisible
 But we are not invisible


In more than 5000 homes friends and neighbors have gathered for online watch parties
 They are committed to this campaign
 Together we will re-elect President Obama


None of us can be silent
 We need all of you in this network and we will win this election because we are the people


Good evening I'm Jennifer Granholm from the great state of Michigan where the trees are just the right height
 Let me tell you a story about the dark days in my home state
 Towards the end of my time as governor Ford closed one of its biggest factories a factory in Wixom Michigan
 The Wixom plant had employed thousands of middle-class men and women in neighborhoods nearyet worlds away fromthe place Mitt Romney was raised


When Ford's decision hit I went down to the local union hall
 It was almost empty a few workers milled about in shock and grief
 I talked to a 45-year-old guy who told me This is the only place I've ever worked


I've been loyal
 I've done everything they've ever asked
 And just like that it's gone
 He looked around the hall and said So governor is it over for us Is the American auto industry dead  Honestly at that moment I just didn't know
 And that was just the beginning
 When the financial crisis hit things got a lot worse  and fast


The entire auto industry and the lives of over one million hard-working Americans teetered on the edge of collapse and with it the whole manufacturing sector
 We looked everywhere for help
 Almost nobody had the guts to help us  not the banks not the private investors and not Bain capital
 Then in 2009 the cavalry arrived our new president Barack Obama


He organized a rescue made the tough calls and saved the American auto industry
 Mitt Romney saw the same crisis and you know what he said Let Detroit go bankrupt
  Sure Mitt Romney loves our lakes and trees


He loves our cars so much they have their own elevator
 But the people who design build and sell those cars

Well in Romney's world the cars get the elevator the workers get the shaft
 Mitt Romney says his business experience qualifies him to be president
 Sure he's made lots of money
 Good for him
 But how did he make that fortune and at whose expense

Too often he made it at the expense of middle-class Americans
 Year after year it was profit before people
 President Obama With the auto rescue he saved more than one million middle-class jobs all across America
 In Colorado the auto rescue saved more than 9800 jobs
 In Virginia more than 19000 jobs
 In North Carolina more than 25000
 Wisconsin more than 28000 jobs
 Pennsylvania more than 34000
 Florida more than 35000
 Ohio more than 150000
 And in the great state of Michigan President Obama helped save 211000 good American jobs
 All across America autos are back
 Manufacturing is rebounding
 Why Because when Mitt Romney said Let Detroit go bankrupt who took the wheel Barack Obama
 When America was losing 750000 jobs per month who gave us a lift Barack Obama
  When American markets broke down who jump-started the engine Barack Obama
 And when America needed it most who got us rolling again on the road to recovery Barack Obama


America let's rev our engines
 In your car and on your ballot the D is for drive forward and the R is for reverse
 And in this election we're driving forward not back
 Let's re-elect our great president Barack Obama


It's an honor to join you tonight for the most important reason I can imagineto make sure that Barack Obama is re-elected president of the United States


Four years ago I was inspired by the way Senator Obama had lived his life fighting for jobs giving hope to the hopeless and working day in and day out for the America he believes in
 I was inspired by Barack Obama's vision for America an America where we look out for one another where we take responsibility for our sisters and brothers and most of all for our children


Back then I was inspired by the promise of Barack Obama's presidency
 Today I'm inspired by his record
 Over the past four years we have had a president who has committed himself and his administration to the values that made America greatsocial justice economic fairness equal opportunity and the belief that if each of us gives back to this country we love and all of us work together there is no challenge we cannot overcome


Those are the ideals my father and my uncles fought for
 Those are the ideals I believe in
 And this election is about whether we will advance those ideals or let them be swept away
 Like my father's election in 1960 this is one of those elections where the future of our country is at stake
 And women and children have the most on the line


The president has been a champion for women's rights
 The first bill he signed was to make sure women can fight for equal pay for equal work
 His commitment to women is about even more than economic rightsit's about health care reproductive rights and our ability to make our own decisions about ourselves our families and our future
 When it comes to what's best for women there is only one candidate in this race who is on our side Barack Obama


As a Catholic woman I take reproductive health seriously and today it is under attack
 This year alone more than a dozen states have passed more than 40 restrictions on women's access to reproductive health care
 That's not the kind of future I want for my daughters or your daughters
 Now isn't the time to roll back the rights we were winning when my father was president
 Now is the time to move this country forward


President Obama has shown the same commitment when it comes to our children
 He has put our ideals into action for the next generationhe has inspired them to get involved he has listened to their ideas and he has committed us all to building a better future for them
 He has challenged states to raise standards for teaching and learningand almost all of them have
 He has fought for early childhood education putting outstanding teachers in every classroom and making college more accessible to all young dreamers


I know Barack Obama will fight for women and children and all Americans because he has proven it
 He has the quality my father most admired in public life courage


Despite critics who said it wasn't good politics President Obama listened to my Uncle Teddy and staked his presidency on making health care accessible to all Americans


Despite an opponent who wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt this president saved the auto industry and now it's coming back strong
  He not only demonstrated the courage to oppose the war in Iraqas president he showed the determination to bring our troops back home


Barack Obama is the kind of leader my father wrote about in Profiles in Courage
 He doesn't just do what's easy
 He does what's hard
 He does what's right
 My father couldn't run for a second term
 It was left to his brothers our family and the generation they inspired to fight for the America he believed in
 Now it's up to a new generation our children's generation to carry America forward


So let me say to the youngand the young at heartBarack Obama is only president because you worked for him
 Because you believed in him
 Because you convinced your parents to vote for him
 Young people have always led America toward a brighter future
 It happened in 1960
 It happened in 2008
 And if you show the same spirit in this election as you did in the last I know that we'll make history again on November 6th


Hello Charlotte
 I am honored to be here as co-chair of President Obama's re-election campaign and so proud of my friend and fellow Texan Julian Castro
 Didn't he do a great job

I feel fortunate to be standing on this stage tonight
 I never could've imagined it growing up
 I was born in Corpus Christi Texas the youngest of four girls including my oldest sister Lisa who has special needs
 My mom was a special education teacher and my dad worked on the Army base
 We weren't wealthy but we were determined to succeed


In my family there was one cardinal priorityeducation
 College was not an option it was mandatory
 So even though we didn't have a lot of money we made it work
 I signed up for financial aid Pell Grants work study anything I could
 Just like our president and first lady I took out loans to pay for school
 Then I changed oil in a mechanic shop flipped burgers at Wendy's taught aerobics and worked on campus to pay them back


Like a lot of you I did whatever it took and four years later I got my degree
 More importantly I got a key to American opportunity
 That's who we area nation that rewards ambition with opportunity
 Where hard work can lead to success no matter where you start
 Traveling the country for the president I see young Americans of every background fighting to succeed
 They're optimistic ambitious hardworking
 But they also want to know that their hard work will pay off


We're lucky our president understands the value of American opportunity because he's lived it
 And he's fighting to help others achieve it
 He's fighting to make college more affordable
 He's cut taxes for every working American
 He's helping small businesses get loans and has cut their taxes eighteen times
 Eighteen times


That's importantsmall businesses create two out of every three new jobs in America
 It's the suburban dad who realizes his neighborhood needs a dry cleaner
 It's the Latina nurse whose block needs a health clinicand she knows she's the one to open it
 It's the high school sophomore who is building Facebook's competitor
 They are the entrepreneurs driving the American economy not Mitt Romney's outsourcing pioneers
 He would raise taxes on middle-class families to cut his ownand mine
 That's not who we are as a nation and here's why The Eva Longoria who worked at Wendy's flipping burgersshe needed a tax break
 But the Eva Longoria who works on movie sets does not


We face a choice this election
 President Obama is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeedjobs education health reform the DREAM Act equal pay for women
 He is moving us forward with opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow
 Mitt Romney wants to take us back to yesterday


But America was built by optimists
 Optimists like my friend Amanda who recently started a small business
 When she went to buy her website addressher first and last nameshe found that someone already owned it but wasn't using it
 So my friend emailed the owner of the site to ask if she could buy it
 The owner wrote back


She is a 13-year-old girl who shares Amanda's name and politely explained that she could not give up the website
 Why Because the younger Amanda plans to be president of the United States and she's going to need the website for her campaign


Here is a girl who at 13 years old firmly believes she can build her American dream
 And here's a president who's building an America where that dream is possible
 Let's fight for the American dream
 Amanda's yours mine all of ours
 We know how to do that
  We know what we need to do
 Let's re-elect President Obama


Hi I'm Beau Biden
 My dad is Joe Biden


A few years ago my father wrote a memoir
 For his title he quoted the line from Robert Frost's famous poem
 He called it Promises to Keep


In the last four years you've seen my father partner with President Obama to keep the promises they made and the sacred promises we made
 The promises we make to our elderly who have earned a dignified retirement
 The promises we make to our children who deserve a chance to succeed
 The promises we make that if you play by the rules and work hard things will work out
 One of those promises is to a group of people close to my heart my brothers and sisters in uniform


Ladies and gentlemen the stakes are high for our country
 There will be and should be a debate about two very different paths
 But there should be no debate about our shared commitment to take care of our veterans


Four years ago I told you that my father has always been there for me my brother and my sister and that as vice president he would be there for you
 And he has


I've seen it
 I've watched him use more than three decades of relationships experience respect and goodwill to help move vital legislation just like he did with the Violence Against Women Act
 I've watched him strengthen relationships with our allies and stare down our adversaries
 I've seen him make quiet visits to veterans' hospitals and private phone calls to the families of first responders killed in the line of duty
 I've seen him salute the workers in factories that are only open because of decisions that he and President Obama had the courage to make
 I've seen him shake the hand of every single student in a graduating class of 900 because he wants those kids to remember the day they got their diplomas and do something big with them


For me the most memorable moment of the past four years was not something most Americans saw
 It wasn't even on American soil
 It took place in Iraq at Camp Victory where I was stationed
 It was the Fourth of July in 2009
 My father was there on an unannounced visit to salute our troops
 I watched as he led a naturalization ceremony in one of Saddam Hussein's palaces for a couple hundred men and women from all branches of our military


As he led those new Americans through the oath of citizenship this celebration of democracy in the land of a deposed dictator I was struck by the strength and diversity of our country
 I was reminded why we as a nation are stronger when everybody has a chance to do their part
 And I was reminded of everything President Obama and my father have done to guarantee that chance


We do have promises to keep
 And my dad and Barack Obama are keeping them
 And yes we have miles to go before we sleep but Joe Biden and Barack Obama are leading the way forward


Four years ago because I was going to Iraq I asked you to be there for my dad and you were
 And for the last four years I can say with certainty he has been there for us


In moments both public and private he is the father I've always known the grandfather my children love and the vice president our nation needs


So tonight it is my great honor to place into nomination for the office of vice president the name of my father my hero Joe Biden
 And I move to suspend the rules and nominate by acclamation Joe Biden as the Democratic Party vice presidential candidate


Fifty-two years ago President Kennedy accepted our party's nomination saying We are not here to curse the darkness we are here to light a candle
 This is the fundamental difference between the party of President Obama and the party of Romney-Ryan
 President Obama has lit candle after candle bringing our country out from the darkness of recession only to see Republicans douse the flames and amuse themselves cursing the darkness
 The Romney-Ryan Republicans however have walked away from bi-partisan efforts to find responsible approaches to moving this country forward bringing only more darkness


The architect of the Republicans' backward blueprint is none other than their vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan
 The Romney-Ryan plan will cut taxes for the wealthiest one percent end the guarantee of Medicare and seek to balance the budget on the backs of hard-working Americans


When too many of our senior citizens were living their golden years in the darkness of economic insecurity Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt and a Democratic Congress created Social Security lighting a candle while the Republicans cursed the darkness
 When too many of our elderly found their lives darkened by unaffordable and inaccessible healthcare Lyndon Johnson and a Democratic Congress lit the candles of Medicare and Medicaid while Republicans stood on the sidelines and cursed the darkness
 When the economy of our country languished in uncertainty William Jefferson Clinton and a Democratic Congress lit the candles that illuminated the pathway to prosperity reducing the deficit and creating over 20 million jobs
 And we did so withthat's rightevery congressional Republican cursing the darkness


When President Obama was sworn into office our economy was losing over 700000 jobs per month
 Affordable quality care for all Americans was an unfulfilled century-old pursuit
 Bin Laden was plotting attacks while our troops were bogged down in Iraq


So President Obama went to work lighting candles
 He promised to bring Osama bin Laden to justice
 Done
 He promised to end the war in Iraq
 Done
 He promised to make membership in Al-Qaeda a high-risk occupation and begin winding down the war in Afghanistan
 Done


And he championed a veterans job corps to put our returning heroes back to work


President Obama's actions saved jobs throughout the automobile industry 1
1 million jobs overall
 Now Ford and Chrysler are making record profits again and General Motors is back to number one
 And President Obama's courage made affordable accessible quality health care a right not a privilege
 We should not run from the term Obamacare
 I am glad Obama cares
 Because Obama cares children born with diabetes can no longer be denied coverage on their parents' insurance policies
 People with catastrophic illnesses can no longer be dropped from coverage when they get sick
 Families will no longer have their benefits capped


Romans 13 verse 12 tells us  The night is far spent the day is at hand Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light
  Let us go from this place lighting candles all across this great country and re-elect President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden so they can continue moving our country forward into the light


My name is Harry Reid the majority leader of the United States Senate and the senator from Searchlight Nevada
 It has been my honor to support and work with President Barack Obama a man who has brought courage and character to the presidency
 President Obama's strength of character leads him to do the right thing even when it isn't the easy thing


Some said he shouldn't save Detroit
 But President Obama made the tough and right call to save more than a million American jobs in an important iconic industry


Some said he shouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden
 But President Obama made the tough and right call to bring the world's worst terrorist to justice


Some said he couldn't take on the big banks that brought our economy to its knees
 But President Obama made the tough and right call so taxpayers will never again be on the hook for Wall Street's risky bets


Some said he couldn't take on the insurance companies that were ripping us off
 But President Obama made the tough and right call to save lives save Medicare and ensure no one goes broke just because they get sick


His whole life there have been so many who told him what he shouldn't or couldn't do
 But America has a president who knows what we must do


President Obama has also faced down another group of naysayers
 In addition to the crowd of couldn'ts and shouldn'ts the Republican Party has become the party of the wouldn'ts and the won'ts
 They pledged on day one they wouldn't lift a finger to help
 And they haven't


In the depth of the Great Recession as millions of Americans were struggling to find work the Republican leader of the senate Mitch McConnell said Republicans' number one goal was to make Barack Obama a one-term president
 They wouldn't cooperate to create jobs
 They wouldn't try to turn around the economy
 They wouldn't do anything but stand in President Obama's way


I've had a front-row seat to watch the Tea Party take over the Republican Party
 For three and a half years they wouldn't govern
 They couldn't lead
 And we shouldn't let them take over the Senate and the White House


We must stop the Tea Party before the United States Senate falls into the hands of extremists and ideologues who leave no room for reason or compromise who don't recognize common ground even when they're standing on it


And if they won't stand up to Rush Limbaugh or Grover Norquist what would make anyone think they would stand up for you

Today's Republican Party believes in two sets of rules one for millionaires and billionaires and another for the middle class
 And this year they've nominated the strongest proponentand clearest beneficiaryof this rigged game Mitt Romney


Never in modern American history has a presidential candidate tried so hard to hide himself from the people he hopes to serve
 When you look at the one tax return he has released it's obvious why there's been only one


We learned that he pays a lower tax rate than middle-class families
 We learned he chose Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island tax shelters over American institutions
 And we can only imagine what new secrets would be revealed if he showed the American people a dozen years of tax returns like his father did


Mitt Romney says we should take his word that he paid his fair share
 His word His word Trust comes from transparency and Mitt Romney comes up short on both
 This is about more than just a piece of paper
 This isn't personal
 This is about leveling with the American people and creating a level playing field for them


If we don't know how Mitt Romney would benefit from the policies he proposes how can we know if he's looking out for us or just himself The American people are still asking Who is Mitt Romney But the American people know Barack Obama
 He is the leader who says we should we can we will
 He is the leader who doesn't search for the easy path for himself but takes the right one for us


This nation has been through hard times
 But those hard times have hardened our resolve
 I'm ready to do the difficult work ahead
 But I want to do that work with Barack Obama and not a Tea Party ideologue
 We can move America forward but we can only do it together


We can move America forward with a strong middle class
 We can move America forward with a strong Democratic majority in the Senate
 And together we can move America forward with Barack Obama in the White House


Our platform crafted by Democrats is not about partisanship but pragmatism not about left or right but about moving America and our economy forward
 Our platformand our presidentstand firm in the conviction that America must continue to out-build out-innovate and out-educate the world


This platform is a clear choice between economic pathways forward or back inclusion or exclusion grow together as a nation or be a country of savage disparities that favor the fortunate few over the greatest driving force of any economya large and robust middle class


We choose forward
 We choose inclusion
 We choose growing together
 We choose American economic might and muscle standing strong on the bedrock of the American ideal a strong empowered and ever-growing middle class
 Our platform emphasizes that a vibrant free and fair market is essential to economic growth


We also must pull from our highest ideals of justice and protect against those ills that destabilized our economylike predatory lending over-leveraged financial institutions and the unchecked avarice of the past that trumped fairness and common sense
 Our platform calls for significant cuts in federal spending
 Our platform calls for a balanced deficit reduction plan where the wealthy pay their fair share


And when your country is in a costly war with our soldiers sacrificing abroad and our nation facing a debt crisis at home being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfareit's patriotism
 But we all knowit's common sensethat for an economy built to last we must invest in what will fuel us for generations to come
 This is our historyfrom the Transcontinental Railroad to the Hoover Dam to the dredging of our ports and building of our most historic bridgesour American ancestors prioritized growth and investment in our nation's infrastructure


And today our businesses industries entrepreneurs and economy realize a return on those investments
 Let us not fall prey to rhetoric that seeks to gut investment and starve our nation of critical common-sense building for our future
 And investment must include the real engine of job growth in America the American small business


That is why I'm proud that our president has made a profound difference for people and businesses in Newark New Jersey and our nation by cutting taxes for 100 percent of working families and giving small businesses 18 different tax cuts


For President Obama home of the brave are not just the last words of our national anthem but also a call to action
 This is why the president's policies and our platform include incentives to train and hire our troops returning home
 Not only because of our moral responsibility but because it makes for a stronger more secure American economy


But investing in people doesn't stop with our troops
 Our platform and our president make it clear that the most critical investment we can make in a 21st-century knowledge-based economy is education
 Our president has already doubled Pell grants raised education standards invested in research and development at our universities and early childhood education in our neighborhoods
 Our platform and our president state it clearly our nation cannot continue to be the world's number one economy if we aren't committed to being the world's number one educator


Our platform and our president are not interested in petty political arguments
 Instead this platform of big and practical ideas sets forth an emboldened pathway toward the historic hope which has driven generations of Americans forwardit is our most fundamental national aspirationthat no matter who you are no matter what your color creed how you choose to pray or who you choose to love that if you are an Americanfirst generation or fifthone who is willing to work hard play by the rules and apply your God-given talentsthat you should be able to find a job that pays the bills


You should be able to afford health care for your family
 You should be able to retire with dignity and respect


And you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger go even farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine


This is our platform
 This is our American mission
 These are the dreams of our fathers and mothers
 This is the demand from the next generation who call to our conscience in a chorus of conviction in classrooms from north to south from sea to shining sea when they proudly proclaim with those sacred words from our most profound pledge that we are a nation with liberty and justice for all


And this November with the re-election of President Barack Obama this generation of Americans will ever expand upon the hope the truth and the promise of America


Mr
 Chairman I am very pleased to move for the adoption of the 2012 Democratic National Platform


Thank you


I'm Nancy Pelosi but my grandchildren call me Mimi
 For me politics is an extension of my role as a mother and a grandmother
 For the Democratic women of the House our work is not about the next election but rather the next generation
 Working with President Barack Obama we are committed to reigniting the American dream the ideal that if you're willing to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility you have the opportunity to climb the ladder of success
 The Democratic women of the House are ready to join President Barack Obama to move America forward


I'm Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and we have work to do
 America's women still make just seventy-seven cents for every dollar men earn
 It's even tougher for women of color
 Those pennies add up to a real difference to middle-class families trying to pay their bills trying to get ahead trying to achieve the American dream
 And we are making progress


The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to give victims of pay discrimination their day in court was the first bill President Obama signed into law
 Now we want to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act real protections to ensure equal pay for equal work
 The Democratic women of the House are committed to closing the wage gap for American families to move America forward


I'm Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney from the great state of New York
 When President Obama made health care a right not a privilege for all Americans it was one of the proudest moments of my life
 Now women are beginning to get the preventive servicesincluding birth controlthat they deserve
 If they get sick or pregnant they won't lose their insurance
 And soon for the first time no longer will being a woman be a pre-existing medical condition


Healthy moms mean healthy families
 When my Republican colleagues held a hearing about birth control and refused to include a single woman on the first panel as a witness I asked Where are the women

Where are the women The women are here
 And we are on our way to re-elect our president
 The Democratic women of the House are committed to women's health and to moving America forward


I'm Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania
 Moving America forward means never going backward on America's great promise of health care for our seniors Medicare
 As a daughter who cared for an elderly parent I know medical care is not optional for seniors
 We will not let the Republicans end the guarantee of Medicare which could cost seniors thousands and endanger the health and retirement security of millions of Americans


Americans have worked for their Medicare
 They have paid for their Medicare
 Whether you're 65 55 45 or 35 you've earned your Medicare
 Americans deserve the security Medicare provides
 President Obama will strengthen and protect Medicare
 Democrats will make the tough choicesthe right choicesto reduce the deficit and to preserve Medicare for this generation and the next
  The Democratic women of the House know that a secure retirement moves America forward


I'm Congresswoman Gwen Moore of Wisconsin mother of three grandmother of three granddaughters
 For our daughters and our granddaughters I'm working to end violence against women
 No victim of domestic violence or bullyingman or womanshould feel unprotected in America
 Yet when Democrats acted to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act Republicans in the House moved to weaken it
 In other legislation they have even tried to change the definition of rape


Vice President Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act
 He President Obama and Democrats are standing strong to prevent violence for allwhether you were born on a reservation or in another country whether you love a man or a woman
 The Democratic women of the House will fight violence against all Americans to move America forward


I'm Congresswoman Nydia Velzquez
 Women in business are helping lead the way for America's economic recovery
 Nearly 8 million American women own small businessesthe engines of job creation and the backbone of the American economy
 And in these tough economic times they need a level playing field and a fair shot to get ahead
 Supporting small businesses means expanding access to credit and supporting investment that will help them grow


Working with President Obama House Democrats gave entrepreneurial Americans the freedom to pursue their passions success and the American dream
 The Democratic women of the House know that when women succeed in our economy we move America forward


Aloha
 I'm Tulsi Gabbard candidate for Congress in Hawai'i and captain in the Army National Guard


When I stepped down from the state legislature and headed to a war zone I joined a long proud line of Americans who sacrificed to make us the land of the free and the home of the brave


As a combat veteran I know the cost of war
 The sacrifices made by our troops and military families are immeasurable
 These days it's often women in uniform moms wives even grandmotherswho deploy and leave their families behind
 Such heroes and patriots need and deserve leaders who truly understand and care about their hardships and will fight for themleaders like President and Michelle Obama and Vice President and Dr
 Bidenthe strongest advocates military families could have
 The Democratic women of the House will honor the service and sacrifice of our troops to move America forward


I'm Joyce Beatty and I'm running for Congress from the great state of Ohio to move America forward
 Moving America forward means higher education that's affordable and prepares our young people to lead in the 21st century economy
 Moving America forward means affordable health care and equal pay for equal work


And to unleash the power of moms in the economy it means quality affordable child care
 We will move America forward on behalf of you your families and communities your aspirations and your hopes for your children


That's because America's success is dependent on the success of women in education in business in the military and in public service
 Women will lead us to victoryfor strong Democratic majorities in Congress and to re-elect Vice-president Joe Biden and President Barack Obama
 The Democratic women of the House are ready to move America forward


From President Obama's hometown of Chicago it is my honor to speak to you about the president I served


I want to tell you what I saw up close in the White House while serving our president in a time of crisis about the values he leans on and the voices he listens to
 When President Obama entered the White House the economy was in a free-fall
 The auto industry on its back
 The banks frozen up
 More than three million Americans had already lost their jobs
 And America's bravest our men and women in uniform were fighting what would soon be the longest wars in our history
 You remember the uncertainty and fear that seized the country


On that first day I said Mr
 President which crisis do you want to tackle first He looked at me with that look he usually reserved for his chief of staff Rahm we were sent here to tackle all of them not choose between them
 There was no blueprint or how-to manual for fixing a global financial meltdown an auto crisis two wars and a great recession all at the same time
 Believe me if it existed I would have found it
 Each crisis was so deep and so dangerous any one of them would have defined another presidency
 We faced a once-in-a-generation moment in American history


Fortunately for all of us we have a once-in-a-generation president
 And in those uncharted waters I saw where the president finds his North Star
 Every night President Obama reads ten letters from everyday Americans


When I met with the president at the end of each day he made sure he had their letters to read at his residenceletters from people just hoping for someone in power to understand their struggles and challenges


I cannot tell you how many timeswhether we were discussing the economy health care or energy prices the president would walk to his desk take out one of their letters read it to all of us and say This is who we are fighting forparents working hard to save for their child's education middle-class Americans fighting tooth-and-nail to hold onto their jobs their homes and life savings
 It is their voices that President Obama brings to the Oval Office
 It is their values I saw him fight for every day
 And in the first month in office he fought for the American Recovery Actto cut taxes for the middle class to put people to work building America's roads rails and runways


And today our economy has gone from losing 800000 jobs a month to adding 4
5 million private-sector jobs in the last 29 months
 Banks are slowly but surely lending again and never again will taxpayers foot the bill for Wall Street's excesses
 In case we forgot that was the change we believed in
 That was the change we fought for
 That was the change President Obama delivered


President Obama took office knowing full well that for the last century presidents had tried to reform our health care system
 Today because of President Obama's courage kids can stay on their parent's plan until they are 26
 Insurers cannot kick you off your policy because you have hit your limit
 They will not be able to deny you because you have a pre-existing condition
 Because of the president's leadership every American will have access to affordable quality health care
 That was the change we believed in
 That was the change we fought for
 That was the change President Obama delivered


I saw the president make the tough calls in the Situation Roomand today our troops in Iraq have finally come home so America can do some nation building here at home
 That was the change that we believed in
 That was the change we fought for
 That was the change President Obama delivered


I remember when the president received a report that the auto industry had a few weeks before collapse
 We met in the Roosevelt Room late into the night
 Some of the president's advisors said that in order to save General Motors you had to let Chrysler go under
 Others said it was throwing good money after bad
 Among all the experts there were only guesses and nobody put it at better than a one-in-four shot
 Only the president suggested going all-in to save the industry


Rising above all the voices in Washington President Obama listened to the voices that mattered to him mostthe voices of the auto workers and the communities that depended on them just like the voices of the steelworkers and communities on the south side of Chicago where he worked earlier in his career
 To President Obama they were not just companies that needed a loan they were communities that needed a leader to stand up for them
 And because President Obama made the right choice over one million Americans are still working today
 The American auto industry is not just surviving
 It is thriving
 Where Mitt Romney was willing to turn his back on Akron Dayton and Toledo Ohio the president said I've got your back


That was the change we believed in
 That was the change we fought for
 That was the change President Obama delivered
 And in those first few months the president worked to put accountability into our children's schools with Race to the Top so that every child has an education that measures up to their full potential
 He was willing to demand change and embrace reform
 The president never changed his views to suit the moment or the audienceand that is also a measure of leadership
 Every challenge was different every choice was difficult but every time the leadership was steady


Now one thing I know with absolute certainty having served two great presidents is that in the next four years an unforeseen crisis challenge or conflict is gonna seize the country
 Whose leadership whose judgment whose values do you want in the White House when that crisis lands like a thud on the Oval Office desk

A person who said in four words Let Detroit go bankrupt or a president who had another four words Not on my watch A person who believes in giving tax cuts to the most fortunate or a president who believes in making college affordable for all Americans A person who wanted to keep don't ask don't tell or a president who believes that who you love should not keep you from serving the country you love

And believe me when the fog of uncertainty that surrounds a crisis storms in to the White House and all the advisors and chiefs of staff have only guesses and hedges to offer it will be the president's leadership that determines how we as a nation meet the challenges that face the middle class
 It is the president's values that shape a future in which the middle class has hope


The person who takes the oath of office in the next four months will shape not just the next four years but the next forty years of our nation
 In these next four years we need proven leadership proven judgment and proven values
 America needs four more years of President Barack Obama


Thank you


I'm Ted Strickland and I come from Duck Run Ohio
 Let me tell you folks in Ohio know what happens when you have a president who stands up for average working people


Ina Sidney is a grandmother who lost her ability to provide for her family when they closed down the auto plant in Perrysburg Ohio
 Ina says thanks to Barack Obama for having the courage to back an industry that others had given up on
 She's an autoworker and a breadwinner once again


As he celebrated the birth of his newborn baby boy Brian Slagle lost his job just at the moment he needed it most
 But today he's back making auto batteries in a factory in Springfield Township Ohio
 And he said there's one reason he has a steady paycheck again Barack Obama refused to let the American auto industry die


James Fayson felt like there was no tomorrow when he was laid off
 I believe in working every day he said and that was taken from me
 Today James is working sixty hours a week on the Jeep Liberty line in Toledo
 He is thrilled to say that his life right now is eat sleep and Jeep
 He's back he said because Barack Obama gave us a chance for a comeback


The auto industry supports one of every eight jobs in Ohio and it's alive and growing in America again
 Late last year Chrysler announced they were hiring eleven hundred new autoworkers in Toledo
 Just last month GM announced a plan to invest 200 million dollars in Lordstown keeping five thousand jobs in Ohio and building the next generation of the Chevy Cruzea car we are proud to say is made entirely in Ohio


It's been a long slog back and we've still got a long way to go
 But all over Ohioall over Americamen and women are going back to work with the pride of building something stamped Made in America
 Before Barack Obama took office it looked like that pride could have vanished forever but today from the staggering depths of the Great Recession the nation has had 29 straight months of job growth
 Workers across my state and across the country are getting back the dignity of a good job and a good salary


Vince Lombardi was right when he said It's not whether you get knocked down it's whether you get back up
 And my friends Ina Sydney Brian Slagle and James Fayson were all knocked down
 But Ina Brian and James are all standing today
 The auto industry is standing today
 The middle class is standing today
 Ohio is standing today
 America is standing strong today


That's what happens when you have a president who stands up for average working people
 President Barack Obama stood up for us and now by God we will stand up for him
 Quite frankly Barack Obama knows what it's like to pay a mortgage and student loans
 He knows what it's like to watch a beloved family member in a medical crisis and worry that treatment is out of reach
 Barack Obama knows our struggles
 And my friends he shares our values


Now Mitt Romney he lives by a different code
 To him American workers are just numbers on a spreadsheet


To him all profits are created equal whether made on our shores or off
 That's why companies Romney invested in were dubbed outsourcing pioneers
 Our nation was built by pioneerspioneers who accepted untold risks in pursuit of freedom not by pioneers seeking offshore profits at the expense of American workers here at home
                                                            

Mitt Romney proudly wrote an op-ed entitled Let Detroit Go Bankrupt
 If he had had his way devastation would have cascaded from Michigan to Ohio and across the nation
 Mitt Romney never saw the point of building something when he could profit from tearing it down
 If Mitt was Santa Claus he'd fire the reindeer and outsource the elves


Mitt Romney has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport
 It summers on the beaches of the Cayman Islands and winters on the slopes of the Swiss Alps
 In Matthew chapter 6 verse 21 the scriptures teach us that where your treasure is there will your heart be also
 My friends any man who aspires to be our president should keep both his treasure and his heart in the United States of America
 And it's well past time for Mitt Romney to come clean with the American people


On what he's saying about the president's policy for welfare to work he's lying
 Simple as that
 On his tax returns he's hiding
 You have to wonder just what is so embarrassing that he's gone to such great lengths to bury the truth Whatever he's doing to avoid taxes can it possibly be worse than the Romney-Ryan tax plan that would have sliced Mitt's total tax rate to less than one percent

My friends there is a true choice in this election
 Barack Obama is betting on the American worker
 Mitt Romney is betting on a Bermuda shell corporation
 Barack Obama saved the American auto industry
 Mitt Romney saved on his taxes
 Barack Obama is an economic patriot
 Mitt Romney is an outsourcing pioneer
 My friends the stakes are too high the differences too stark to sit this one out
 Let us stand as one on November 6th and move this country forward by re-electing President Barack Obama


From 1965 to 1967 my dad Jack Gilligan served in Congress and helped pass landmark laws like the Voting Rights Act
  Dad later became a great governor of Ohio but one of his proudest accomplishments was when as a congressman he helped draft and pass Medicare
  Today at 91 my father is a happy beneficiary of that effort to bring quality health care to every senior citizen
 And President Obama is building upon that legacy by bringing quality and secure health care to every American


I was governor of Kansas when Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts
 Many of us watched in amazementenvy evenas he passed a universal health care law in his state
 Well Republicans may see Romneycare as a scarlet letter
  But for us Democrats Obamacare is a badge of honor
 Because no matter who you are what stage of life you're in this law is a good thing


First if you already have insurance you like you can keep it
  Insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions
 That's what change looks like


More than five million seniors have already saved money on their prescription drugs and almost 33 million have benefited from free preventive services
 The president cracked down hard on Medicare and health care fraud recovering a record-breaking 10
7 billion over the last three years protecting our seniors
 That's what change looks like


The law gives tax credits to 360000 small businesses so they can give their employees coverage and an array of affordable private insurance plans to choose from
 That's what change looks like


If you're self-employed between jobs or can't get insurance through work you'll have access to affordable health insurance as good as Congressman Paul Ryan's
 That's what change looks like


If you're under 26 you can stay on your parents' plan
 You can go back to school or get extra training without fear of a health catastrophe bankrupting your family
 Over three million previously uninsured young adults are now on their parents' plans
  That's what change looks like


And under Obamacare insurance companies can no longer discriminate against women
 Before some wouldn't cover women's most basic needs like contraception and maternity care but would still charge us up to 50 percent more than menfor a worse plan
  They said women who had C-sections or survived breast cancer or even domestic violence had pre-existing conditions and would deny them coverage
 But this president made it illegal to discriminate against women and ended the practice of insurance companies charging women higher premiums than men for the same coverage
 This president ensured women's free access to preventive services like breast cancer screenings
 Being a mother is no longer a liability and being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition
 That's what change looks like


Today nearly 13 million Americans are experiencing something remarkable Instead of sending checks to their insurance companies insurance companies are sending checks to themover a billion dollars this year alone


Because if insurers don't spend at least 80 percent of your premium dollars on your health care you get a refund
 That's what change looks like


I've spent my career fighting the worst practices of insurance companies
 I know how tough it is to stand up to powerful forces that prey on consumers
  Governor Romney and Paul Ryan know how tough it is too
 That's why they won't do it
 They'll let insurance companies continue to cherry-pick who gets coverage and who gets left out priced out or locked out of the market
  President Obama is making sure that everyonefrom cancer survivors to children with asthmacan get the care they need


What's missing from the Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare is Medicare
 Instead of the Medicare guarantee Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what is covered costing seniors as much as 6400 more a year
 President Obama extended the program's life by eight years while improving seniors' benefits and strengthened the Medicare guarantee
 The president agrees with you no vouchers


Romney and Ryan will take away women's basic health services and turn a blind eye to insurance discrimination


President Obama stands up for women giving us control over our own health care
  Romney and Ryan would put insurance companies back in control


Barack Obama was raised by Kansas women and I know Kansas women
 They taught him the values of hard work responsibility and fairness
 That's why President Obama believes that if you work hard and play by the rules you deserve the security of health care


Governor Romney Congressman Ryan and their Republican colleagues say it's everyone for themselves
 And that fundamentally is the choice in this election
 Between Republicans who only fight for the favored few or a president who fights for the middle class
 Between a nation whose politics play on the worst of our fears and a nation whose laws reflect the best of our values


Forty-seven years ago my dad proudly watched President Johnson sign Medicare into law
  That day President Johnson said few people have the courage to stake reputation and position and the effort of a lifetime upon such a cause when there are so few that share it


President Obama is one of those people
 A leader with uncommon compassion and uncommon courage
 He has earned more than our gratitude
 He has earned four more years


Delegates and fellow Americans it is an honor to be with you this evening
  And it's an honor to represent the great state of Illinois the home of President Barack Obama


Tonight I want to talk to you about a scary subject for many many Republicans
 I want to talk about facts
 You know I watched the Republican National Convention last week and I heard a lot of things that are simply not true
 

One of our founding fathers President John Adams of Massachusetts once said that facts are stubborn things
  But last week as they nominated a very different man from Massachusetts Republicans stubbornly smeared President Obama's excellent record of reforming welfare
 They went on and on pretending that he weakened its work requirement
 Everyone knows that is a ridiculous charge
 Even the Republican author of Welfare Reform says Romney is wrong
  Fact-checkers have called this talking point blatantly false a drastic distortion and widely debunked and a mind-boggling act of untruth telling


In Illinois we know President Barack Obama
 We know his record
 And we know that President Obama has made sure that work is always part of welfare
 As an Illinois State Senator Barack Obama spearheaded welfare reform in the Land of Lincoln
 And the fact is under President Obama states can get flexibility only if they move 20 percent more people to work


Let me repeat that for our Republican friends more people working not less
 Then there's Medicare
 Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to take away the promise that makes Medicare Medicare
 They want to give seniors a voucher that caps what Medicare will cover and then tell seniors they're on their own for what's left
 That would cost seniors thousands of dollars a year
 And if they don't have the money it could cost them their lives
 But that didn't stop Romney and Ryan from telling the American people that their plan won't hurt seniors
 The fact is it will
 President Obama's plan will protect Medicare and protect our seniors


Facts are stubborn things
 Now when Paul Ryan got his turn he blamed President Obama for a plant that closed under President George W
 Bush
 Here's a fact when President Obama took office in January 2009 the Chrysler plant in Belvidere Illinois employed just 200 people
  Today because President Obama saved the auto industry that same Chrysler plant is employing more than 4000 American workers


There's something else the Republicans left out of their convention any explanation of why they call Mitt Romney Governor Romney
 We already knew this extremely conservative man takes some pretty liberal deductions
 Evidently that includes writing off all four years he served as Governor of Massachusetts


And if you want to know how someone's going to govern the country look at how he governed his state


Mitt Romney promised Massachusetts three things more jobs less debt and smaller government
 Then he left his state 47th out of 50 in job growth added 2
6 billion in debt and on his watch government jobs grew six times faster than private-sector jobs
 What does Romney promise today More jobs less debt and smaller government
 But he didn't do it then and he won't do it now


From day one President Obama has told you where he stands what he believes and what he is doing to make our middle class strong again
 America is moving forward under President Obama's leadershipand that's a fact
 Now it's our job in the next nine weeks to make sure that the American people know the facts


Your vote is a valuable thing
 Entrust it to someone who respects you enough to tell you the truth
 Join me in voting for President Obama and together let's make the will of the people the law of the land


Thank you very much


Good evening I'm Lilly Ledbetter and I'm here tonight to say What a difference four years make


Some of you may know my story How for nineteen years I worked as a manager for a tire plant in Alabama
 And some of you may have lived a similar story After nearly two decades of hard proud work I found out that I was making significantly less money than the men who were doing the same work as me
 I went home talked to my husband and we decided to fight


We decided to fight for our family and to fight for your family too
 We sought justice because equal pay for equal work is an American value
 That fight took me ten years
 It took me all the way to the Supreme Court
 And in a 54 decision they stood on the side of those who shortchanged my pay my overtime and my retirement just because I am a woman


The Supreme Court told me that I should have filed a complaint within six months of the company's first decision to pay me less even though I didn't know about it for nearly two decades
 And if we hadn't elected President Barack Obama the Supreme Court's wrongheaded interpretation would have been the law of the land


And that would have been the end of the story
 But with President Obama on our side even though I lost before the Supreme Court we won
 The first bill that President Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
 I think it says something about his priorities that the first bill he put his name on has my name on it too


As he said that day with me by his side Making our economy work means making sure it works for everyone


The president signed the bill for his grandmother whose dreams hit the glass ceiling And for his daughters so that theirs never will
 Because of his leadership women who faced pay discrimination like I did will now get their day in court


That was the first step but it can't be the last
 Because women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar men make
 Those pennies add up to real money
 It's real money for the little things like being able to take your kids to the movies and for the big things like sending them to college
 It's paying your rent this month and paying the mortgage in the future
 It's having savings for the bill you didn't expect and savings for the dignified retirement you've earned


Maybe 23 cents doesn't sound like a lot to someone with a Swiss bank account Cayman Island Investments and an IRA worth tens of millions of dollars
 But Governor Romney when we lose 23 cents every hour every day every paycheck every job over our entire lives what we lose can't just be measured in dollars


Three years ago the house passed the paycheck Fairness Act to level the playing field for America's women
 Senate Republicans blocked it
 Mitt Romney won't even say if he supports it
 President Obama does
 In the end I didn't get a dime of the money I was shortchanged


But this fight became bigger than Lilly Ledbetter
 Today it's about my daughter
 It's about my granddaughter
 It's about women and men
 It's about families
 It's about equality and justice


This cause which bears my name is bigger than me
 It's as big as all of you
 This fight which began as my own is now our fighta fight for the fundamental American values that make our country great
 And with President Barack Obama we're going to win
 Thank you very much
 God bless America


This is the election of a lifetime
 Because more than any one candidate or policy what's at stake is the American dream
 That dreamthe ability to imagine a better way for ourselves and our families and then reach for itis central to who we are and what we stand for as a nation
 Whether that dream endures for another generation depends on you and me
 It depends on who leads us too


As prepared for delivery

In Massachusetts we know Mitt Romney
 By the time he left office Massachusetts was 47th in the nation in job creationduring better economic timesand household income in our state was declining
 He cut education deeper than anywhere else in America
 Roads and bridges were crumbling
 Business taxes were up and business confidence was down
 Our clean energy potential was stalled
 And we had a structural budget deficit
 Mitt Romney talks a lot about all the things he's fixed
 I can tell you that Massachusetts wasn't one of them
 He's a fine fellow and a great salesman but as governor he was more interested in having the job than doing it


When I came to office we set out on a different course investing in ourselves and our future
 And today Massachusetts leads the nation in economic competitiveness student achievement health care coverage life sciences and biotech energy efficiency and veterans' services
 Today with the help of the Obama administration we are rebuilding our roads and bridges and expanding broadband access
 Today we're out of the deficit hole Mr
 Romney left and we've achieved the highest bond rating in our history
 Todaywith labor at the tablewe've made the reforms in our pension and benefits systems our schools our transportation system and more that Mr
 Romney only talked about
 And today in Massachusetts you can also marry whomever you love
 We have much more still to do
 But we are on a better track because we placed our faith not in trickle-down fantasies and divisive rhetoric but in our values and common sense


The same choice faces the nation today
 All that today's Republicans are saying is that if we just shrink government cut taxes crush unions and wait all will be well
 Never mind that those are the very policies that got us into recession to begin with
 Never mind that not one of the governors who preached that gospel in Tampa last week has the results to show for it
 But we Democrats owe America more than a strong argument for what we are against
 We need to be just as strong about what we are for


The question is What do we believe We believe in an economy that grows opportunity out to the middle class and the marginalized not just up to the well connected
 We believe that freedom means keeping government out of our most private affairs including out of a woman's decision whether to keep an unwanted pregnancy and everybody's decision about whom to marry
 We believe that we owe the next generation a better country than we found and that every American has a stake in that
 We believe that in times like these we should turn to each other not on each other
 We believe that government has a role to play not in solving every problem in everybody's life but in helping people help themselves to the American dream
 That's what Democrats believe


If we want to win elections in November and keep our country moving forward if we want to earn the privilege to lead it's time for Democrats to stiffen our backbone and stand up for what we believe
 Quit waiting for pundits or polls or super PACs to tell us who the next president or senator or congressman is going to be
 We're Americans


We shape our own future
 Let's start by standing up for President Barack Obama


This is the president who delivered the security of affordable health care to every single American after 90 years of trying
 This is the president who brought Osama bin Laden to justice who ended the war in Iraq and is ending the war in Afghanistan
 This is the president who ended don't ask don't tell so that love of country not love of another determines fitness for military service
 Who made equal pay for equal work the law of the land
 This is the president who saved the American auto industry from extinction the American financial industry from self-destruction and the American economy from depression
 Who added over 4
5 million private sector jobs in the last two-plus years more jobs than George W
 Bush added in eight


The list of accomplishments is long impressive and barely toldeven more so when you consider that congressional Republicans have made obstruction itself the centerpiece of their governing strategy
 With a record and a vision like that I will not stand by and let him be bullied out of officeand neither should you and neither should you and neither should you


What's at stake is real
 The Orchard Gardens Elementary School in Boston was in trouble
 Its record was poor its spirit was broken and its reputation was a wreck
 No matter how bad things were in other urban schools in the city people would say At least we're not Orchard Gardens
  Today thanks to a host of new tools many enacted with the help of the Obama administration Orchard Gardens is turning itself around
 Teaching standards and accountabilities are higher
 The school day is longer and filled with experiential learning art exercise and music


The head of pediatric psychology from a local hospital comes to consult with faculty and parents on the toughest personal situations in students' home lives
 Attendance is up thanks to a mentoring initiative
 In less than a year Orchard Gardens went from one of the worst schools in the district to one of the best in the state
 The whole school community is engaged and proud


So am I
 At the end of my visit a year and a half ago the first gradeled by a veteran teachergathered to recite Dr
 King's I have a dream speech
 When I started to applaud the teacher said not yet
  Then she began to ask those six- and seven-year-olds questions  What does 'creed' mean What does 'nullification' mean  Where is Stone Mountain  And as the hands shot up I realized that she had taught the children not just to memorize that speech but to understand it


Today's Republicans and their nominee for president tell us that those first-graders are on their ownon their own to deal with their poverty with ill-prepared young parents maybe who speak English as a second language with an underfunded school with neighborhood crime and blight with no access to nutritious food and no place for their mom to cash a paycheck with a job market that needs skills they don't have with no way to pay for college


But those Orchard Gardens kids should not be left on their own
 Those children are America's children too yours and mine
 And among them are the future scientists entrepreneurs teachers artists engineers laborers and civic leaders we desperately need
 For this country to rise they must riseand they and their cause must have a champion in the White House


That champion is Barack Obama
 That cause is the American dream
 Let's fight for that
 Let's canvass and phone bank and get out the vote for that
 Let's go tell everyone we meet that when the American dream is at stake you want Barack Obama in charge


Thank you
 God bless you
 And God bless the United States


Thank you
 Tonight I have the honor of introducing you to our keynote speaker my twin brother Julian Castro


As you can imagine this is a very special moment for our family
 For each of us the places that we call home shape our character inform how we see the world and inspire our imagination


Julian is a proud Texan
 For 18 years we shared a small room and big dreams in our neighborhood on the West Side of San Antonio
 Our hometown is a beautiful place a place of hardworking humble folks who grind out a living by day and go home and say prayers of thanks to God at night


Since becoming mayor in 2009 Julian has worked tirelessly to pursue policies that honor the aspirations of the people he represents
 I'm proud that my brother has achieved his dreams but I'm even more proud of the work he's done to help others achieve theirs
 Today San Antonio is our nation's seventh largest city a city on the rise that looks like America tomorrow


Julian is a dedicated husband to his wife Erica a public school teacher and a wonderful father to his three-year-old daughter Carina


With much love and pride I present to you my best friend and my brother Mayor Julian Castro


My fellow Democrats my fellow Texans my fellow Americans I stand before you tonight as a young American a proud American of a generation born as the Cold War receded shaped by the tragedy of 911 connected by the digital revolution and determined to re-elect the man who will make the 21st century another American centuryPresident Barack Obama


The unlikely journey that brought me here tonight began many miles from this podium
 My brother Joaquin and I grew up with my mother Rosie and my grandmother Victoria
 My grandmother was an orphan
 As a young girl she had to leave her home in Mexico and move to San Antonio where some relatives had agreed to take her in
 She never made it past the fourth grade
 She had to drop out and start working to help her family
 My grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid a cook and a babysitter barely scraping by but still working hard to give my mother her only child a chance in life so that my mother could give my brother and me an even better one


As my grandmother got older she begged my mother to give her grandchildren
 She prayed to God for just one grandbaby before she died
 You can imagine her excitement when she found out her prayers would be answeredtwice over
 She was so excited that the day before Joaquin and I were born she entered a menudo cook-off and she won 300
 That's how she paid our hospital bill


By the time my brother and I came along this incredible woman had taught herself to read and write in both Spanish and English
 I can still see her in the room that Joaquin and I shared with her reading her Agatha Christie novels late into the night
 And I can still remember her every morning as Joaquin and I walked out the door to school making the sign of the cross behind us saying Que dios los bendiga
 May God bless you


My grandmother didn't live to see us begin our lives in public service
 But she probably would have thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in San Antonio one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his waythe good people of San Antonio willingto the United States Congress


My family's story isn't special
 What's special is the America that makes our story possible
 Ours is a nation like no other a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation
 No matter who you are or where you come from the path is always forward


America didn't become the land of opportunity by accident
 My grandmother's generation and generations before always saw beyond the horizons of their own lives and their own circumstances
 They believed that opportunity created today would lead to prosperity tomorrow
 That's the country they envisioned and that's the country they helped build
 The roads and bridges they built the schools and universities they created the rights they fought for and wonthese opened the doors to a decent job a secure retirement the chance for your children to do better than you did


And that's the middle classthe engine of our economic growth
 With hard work everybody ought to be able to get there
 And with hard work everybody ought to be able to stay thereand go beyond
 The dream of raising a family in a place where hard work is rewarded is not unique to Americans
 It's a human dream one that calls across oceans and borders
 The dream is universal but America makes it possible
 And our investment in opportunity makes it a reality


Now in Texas we believe in the rugged individual
 Texas may be the one place where people actually still have bootstraps and we expect folks to pull themselves up by them
 But we also recognize there are some things we can't do alone
 We have to come together and invest in opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow


And it starts with education
 Twenty years ago Joaquin and I left home for college and then for law school
 In those classrooms we met some of the brightest folks in the world
 But at the end of our days there I couldn't help but to think back to my classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio
 They had the same talent the same brains the same dreams as the folks we sat with at Stanford and Harvard
 I realized the difference wasn't one of intelligence or drive
 The difference was opportunity


In my city of San Antonio we get that
 So we're working to ensure that more four-year-olds have access to pre-K
 We opened Cafe College where students get help with everything from test prep to financial aid paperwork
 We know that you can't be pro-business unless you're pro-education
 We know that pre-K and student loans aren't charity
 They're a smart investment in a workforce that can fill and create the jobs of tomorrow
 We're investing in our young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorrow


And it's paying off
 Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top performing local economy
 And we're only getting started
 Opportunity today prosperity tomorrow


Now like many of you I watched last week's Republican convention
 They told a few stories of individual success
 We all celebrate individual success
 But the question is how do we multiply that success The answer is President Barack Obama


Mitt Romney quite simply doesn't get it
 A few months ago he visited a university in Ohio and gave the students there a little entrepreneurial advice
 Start a business he said
 But how Borrow money if you have to from your parents he told them
 Gee why didn't I think of that Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents but that shouldn't determine whether you can pursue your dreams
 I don't think Governor Romney meant any harm
 I think he's a good guy
 He just has no idea how good he's had it


We know that in our free market economy some will prosper more than others
 What we don't accept is the idea that some folks won't even get a chance
 And the thing is Mitt Romney and the Republican Party are perfectly comfortable with that America
 In fact that's exactly what they're promising us


The Romney-Ryan budget doesn't just cut public education cut Medicare cut transportation and cut job training


It doesn't just pummel the middle classit dismantles it
 It dismantles what generations before have built to ensure that everybody can enter and stay in the middle class
 When it comes to getting the middle class back to work Mitt Romney says No
 When it comes to respecting women's rights Mitt Romney says No
 When it comes to letting people marry whomever they love Mitt Romney says No
 When it comes to expanding access to good health care Mitt Romney says No


Actually Mitt Romney said Yes and now he says No
 Governor Romney has undergone an extreme makeover and it ain't pretty
 So here's what we're going to say to Mitt Romney
 We're going to say No


Of all the fictions we heard last week in Tampa the one I find most troubling is this If we all just go our own way our nation will be stronger for it
 Because if we sever the threads that connect us the only people who will go far are those who are already ahead
 We all understand that freedom isn't free
 What Romney and Ryan don't understand is that neither is opportunity
 We have to invest in it


Republicans tell us that if the most prosperous among us do even better that somehow the rest of us will too
 Folks we've heard that before
 First they called it trickle-down
 Then supply-side
 Now it's Romney-Ryan
 Or is it Ryan-Romney Either way their theory has been tested
 It failed
 Our economy failed
 The middle class paid the price
 Your family paid the price


Mitt Romney just doesn't get it
 But Barack Obama gets it
 He understands that when we invest in people we're investing in our shared prosperity
 And when we neglect that responsibility we risk our promise as a nation
 Just a few years ago families that had never asked for anything found themselves at risk of losing everything
 And the dream my grandmother held that work would be rewarded that the middle class would be there if not for her then for her childrenthat dream was being crushed


But then President Obama took officeand he took action
 When Detroit was in trouble President Obama saved the auto industry and saved a million jobs
 Seven presidents before himDemocrats and Republicanstried to expand health care to all Americans
 President Obama got it done
 He made a historic investment to lift our nation's public schools and expanded Pell grants so that more young people can afford college
 And because he knows that we don't have an ounce of talent to waste the president took action to lift the shadow of deportation from a generation of young law-abiding immigrants called dreamers


I believe in you
 Barack Obama believes in you
 Now it's time for Congress to enshrine in law their right to pursue their dreams in the only place they've ever called home America


Four years ago America stood on the brink of a depression
 Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition our president took action and now we've seen 4
5 million new jobs
 He knows better than anyone that there's more hard work to do but we're making progress
 And now we need to make a choice


It's a choice between a country where the middle class pays more so that millionaires can pay lessor a country where everybody pays their fair share so we can reduce the deficit and create the jobs of the future
 It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell grantsor a nation that invests more in education
 It's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseasor a leader who brings jobs back home


This is the choice before us
 And to me to my generation and for all the generations to come our choice is clear
 Our choice is a man who's always chosen us
 A man who already is our president Barack Obama


In the end the American dream is not a sprint or even a marathon but a relay
 Our families don't always cross the finish line in the span of one generation
 But each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labor
 My grandmother never owned a house
 She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own
 But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college
 And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop I could hold this microphone


And while she may be proud of me tonight I've got to tell you Mom I'm even more proud of you
 Thank you Mom
 Today my beautiful wife Erica and I are the proud parents of a three-year-old little girl Carina Victoria named after my grandmother


A couple of Mondays ago was her first day of pre-K
 As we dropped her off we walked out of the classroom and I found myself whispering to her as was once whispered to me Que dios te bendiga
 May God bless you
 She's still young and her dreams are far off yet but I hope she'll reach them
 As a dad I'm going to do my part and I know she'll do hers
 But our responsibility as a nation is to come together and do our part as one community one United States of America to ensure opportunity for all of our children


The days we live in are not easy ones but we have seen days like this before and America prevailed
 With the wisdom of our founders and the values of our families America prevailed
 With each generation going further than the last America prevailed
 And with the opportunity we build today for a shared prosperity tomorrow America will prevail


It begins with re-electing Barack Obama
 It begins with you
 It begins now
 Que dios los bendiga
 May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America
